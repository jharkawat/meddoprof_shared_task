Cloning guides to lentiCRISPR v2
Digest the lentiCRISPRv2 vector : 3 g vector2 l 10X Tango buffer (Thermo Fisher) 1 l 20mM DTT1-1.5 l Esp3I (Thermo Fisher) Water to 20 l
In thermocycler:37 C for 4 hours, inactivate at 65 C for 20 mins, keep at 4 C
SKIP the alkaline phosphatase step.
Use a gel purification/PCR cleanup kit (Qiagen) WITHOUT running on a gel
Optional : run ~200ng of the purified vector on a gel to verify digestion.
Anneal and phosphorylate gRNA oligos pair:1 l of each oligo (100 M stock) 1 l 10X T4 ligation buffer (not PNK buffer) 0.5 l T4 PNKWater to 10 l
In thermocycler : 37 C for 30 mins, 95 C for 5 mins, ramp down to 25 C at 0.1 C/sec (or 5-6 C/min)
Optional : keep at 4 C.
Serially dilute the annealed oligos to 1:500.
Out of ligation at a vector : insert molar ratios of 1:5, 1:10, 1:20.
I found that 1:5 works best
50ng vector1.5 l 10X T4 ligation buffer (NEB) 1 l T4 ligase (NEB) 2 l diluted oligos (1:500) Water to 15 lIncubate at RT for 1-2 hours.
Transform 5 l of the ligation reaction to 50 l Stbl3 chemically competent cells
If you incubate the Stbl3 cells at 30 C the colonies will be VERY small so look for them carefully.
Incubating them at 37 C did n't result in LTR recombination in my hands.
