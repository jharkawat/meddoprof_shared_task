DNA extraction from gram negative bacteria for ONT MinION sequencing
1 ) Inoculate single bacterial colony into 2 ml of appropriate growth media2 ) Incubate overnight 37oC with shaking3 ) Transfer 1.5 ml of overnight culture into microfuge tube4 ) Pellet bacteria 5 ) Remove supernatantNOTEAt this stage bacterial pellet can be sored at -80oC for gDNA extraction at a later date with no compromise to extraction .
1 ) Dissolve lypholised RNase A American Bioanalytical # AB14043 ) in 50 % glycerol and 10 mM Tris ( pH 8.0 ) to a final concentration of 100 mg/ml ( stock can be sorted at -20oC for future use ) 2 ) Dissolve lypholised Genfind proteinase K in Genfind proteinase K buffer to a final concentration of 96 mg/ml ( stock can be sorted at -20oC for future use ) 3 ) For each bacterial ioslate to be extracted make a lysis master mix containing 400 ul Genfind lysis buffer , 9 ul Genfind proteinsae K and 1 ul RNase A ( see step 1 ) 4 ) Add 400 ul of the lysis master mix to each bacterial pellet5 ) Gently tip mix 10 times to enusre the bacterial pellet is well resuspended6 ) Incubate at 37oC for 30 minutes7 ) Procedd to DNA extraction .
1 ) Invert the Genfind binding buffer 20 times to ensure complete resuspension of the magnetic particles2 ) Add 300 ul of the Genfind binding buffer to each of the samples and gently tip mix 10 times , avoid generating bubbles
The magentic particles will most likely clump together at this stage due to the high concentration of DNA in the sample.3 ) Incubate samples at room temperature for 5 minutes4 ) Place the sample on a magentic rack for 5 minutes or until solution completely clears5 ) With the tubes on the magnet remove the supernatant avoiding the magentic particles6 ) Remove samples from the magnet7 ) Add 800 ul of Genfind wash buffer 1 to each of the samples8 ) Gently tip mix each sample 10 times
The idea is to try and resuspend the magentic beads but this will most likely not be possible as they will clump together
I try to make sure the clumps of beads move in and out of the pipette tip with each mix9 ) Place the sample on a magentic rack for 5 minutes or until solution completely clears10 ) Repeat steps 7-10 for a total of two washes with Genfind wash buffer 111 ) Add 500 ul of Genfind wash buffer 2 to each of the samples12 ) Gently tip mix each sample 10 times
I try to make sure the clumps of beads move in and out of the pipette tip with each mix13 ) Place the sample on a magentic rack for 5 minutes or until solution completely clears14 ) Repeat steps 11-13 for a total of two washes with Genfind wash buffer 215 ) Briefly centrifuge samples to bring all liquid to the bottom of the tube16 ) Place the sample on a magentic rack for 5 minutes or until solution completely clears17 ) Remove all traces of wash buffer 2 with a pipette , but do not allow beads to fully dry out .
18 ) Add 50-200 ul of 10 mM Tris pH 8.0 to each sample ( I usually start with 100 ul but it will depend on the groth dynamics of your baccteria ) 19 ) Remove samples from the magnet20 ) Gently tip mix each sample 10 times and incubate at 37oC for 5 minutes then tip mix again
To ensure elution of DNA off the particles it is crucial that the magentic particles are completely resuspended
If it is not possble to entirle resuspend particles then add more 10 mM Tris.21 ) Place the sample on a magentic rack for 5 minutes or until solution completely clears22 ) Tranfer supenatant to a clean microfuge tube .
Try to avoid carryover of magnetic particles into the supernatant
NOTEAfter extraction DNA should be stored at 4oC to minimise any damage .
Storage at -20oC will result in ice crystal formation that will shear you DNA
I try to do my DNA extractions on the smae day as my library prep but have stored DNA at 4oC for a couple of weeks and still amde sucessful libraries .

Discard the supernatant by pouring off the liquid removing all growth media .
Set a P1000 pipette on 900 l and resuspend the bacterial pellet into 900 l of lysis buffer ( preheated at 65 C ) by pipetting up and down vigorously 10 times ( with an uncut P1000 tip ) .
This step is critical for the yield and it is very important to pipette the complete liquid up and down vigorously so all the liquid enters the pipette tip during mixing .
Apparition of foam is good .
Incubate at 65 C in a dry bath for 20 minutes ( invert the tube vigorously 10 times after 10 minutes ) .
Spin down the tube for 1 second .

Discard the supernatant by pipetting without taking out any beads .
Add 1 mL of fresh 70 % ethanol .
Close the tube and resuspend the beads by inverting the tube 20 times .
It is very important that the beads are resuspended in ethanol to ensure an efficient wash .
If beads are still stuck to the wall of the tube you can flick the tube to resuspend them .
Put the tube back on the magnetic rack .
At this step , beads move immediately to the wall of the tube .
Remove the supernatant without disturbing the beads .
Repeat the steps 20 to 24 to wash the beads one more time .
Spin down the tube to bring all the droplets to the bottom of the tube .
Put the tube back on the magnetic rack and remove all the ethanol with a P200 or P10 pipette .
Let beads air drying for a maximum of 30 seconds or else it can affect the DNA integrity and reduce the yield .

Resuspend the beads by flicking the tube ( make sure they are not aggregated anymore ) .
Incubate the tube for 15 minutes at 37 C .
Flick the tube again .
Place the tube on a magnetic rack and wait for the solution to become clear .
This can be time consuming when the gDNA solution is very concentrated ( > 200ng/ l ) .
You can add additional elution buffer or just wait for hours !
Transfer the solution into a new tube .
Check the DNA purity by measuring the gDNA concentration with a Qubit and a Nanodrop .
Qubit/Nanodrop ratio should be around 1.2 ( Qubit concentration is higher than Nanodrop concentration for Xanthomonas gDNA )
Typically gDNA concentration is between 50 and 200 ng/ l
A260/A280 ratio should be 1.8 2 .
If this ratio is > 2 it is likely that the sample is contaminated by RNA .
RNA contamination also leads to a shift between Qubit and Nanodrop concentrations .
To get rid of RNA , you can follow the additional purification n 1 below ( Additional purification 1 : RNA removal starting from step 36 )
A260/A230 ratio should be 2 2.2 .
If this ratio is < 2 you can follow the purification below ( Additional purification 2 : A260/A230 improvement starting from step 43 ) .
Check the DNA integrity by running the sample on PFGE or capillary electrophoresis .
The sample should range from 10-20kb to 100-150kb .

nCoV-2019 sequencing protocol
Mix the following components in an 0.2mL 8-strip tube ;
Viral RNA input from a clinical sample should be between Ct 18-35 .
If Ct is between 12-15 , then dilute the sample 100-fold in water , if between 15-18 then dilute 10-fold in water .
This will reduce the likelihood of PCR-inhibition .
A mastermix should be made up in the mastermix cabinet and aliquoted into PCR strip tubes .
Tubes should be wiped down when entering and leaving the mastermix cabinet .
Gently mix by pipetting and pulse spin the tube to collect liquid at the bottom of the tube .
Incubate the reaction as follows :
65 C for 00:05:00
Place on ice for 00:01:00
Add the following to the annealed template RNA :
A mastermix should be made up in the mastermix cabinet and added to the denatured RNA in the extraction and sample addition cabinet .
If required resuspend lyophilised primers at a concentration of 100 M each
nCov-2019/V1 primers for this protocol were designed using Primal Scheme and generate overlapping 400nt amplicons .
Primer names and dilutions are listed in the table below .
Generate primer pool stocks by adding 5 l of each primer pair to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf labelled either Pool 1 ( 100 M ) or Pool 2 ( 100 M ) .
Total volume should be 490 l for Pool 1 ( 100 M ) and 490 l for Pool 2 ( 100 M ) .
These are your 100 M stocks of each primer pool .
Primers should be diluted and pooled in the mastermix cabinet which should be cleaned with decontamination wipes and UV sterilised before and after use .
Dilute this primer pool 1:10 in molecular grade water , to generate 10 M primer stocks .
It is recommend that multiple aliquots of each primer pool are made to in case of degradation or contamination .
Primers need to be used at a final concentration of 0.015 M per primer .
In this case both pools have 98 primers in so the requirement is 3.6 L primer pools ( 10uM ) per 25 L reaction .
For other schemes , adjust the volume added appropriately .
In the mastermix hood set up the multiplex PCR reactions as follows in 0.2mL 8-strip PCR tubes :
A PCR mastermix for each pool should be made up in the mastermix cabinet and aliquoted into PCR strip tubes .
In the extraction and sample addition cabinet add 2.5 l cDNA to each tube and mix well by pipetting .
The extraction and sample addition cabinet should should be cleaned with decontamination wipes and UV sterilised before and after use .
Pulse centrifuge the tubes to collect the contents at the bottom of the tube .
Set-up the following program on the thermal cycler :
Cycle number should be 25 for Ct 18-21 up to a maximum of 35 cycles for Ct 35
Combine the entire contents of Pool 1 and Pool 2 PCR reactions for each biological sample into to a single 1.5 mlEppendorf tube .
Clean-up the amplicons using the following protocol :
Amplicon clean-up should be performed in the post-PCR cabinet which should should be cleaned with decontamination wipes and UV sterilised before and after use .
Vortex SPRI beads thoroughly to ensure they are well resuspended , the solution should be a homogenous brown colour .
Add an equal volume ( 1:1 ) of SPRI beads to the sample tube and mix gently by either flicking or pipetting .
For example add 50 l SPRI beads to a 50 l reaction .
Pulse centrifuge to collect all liquid at the bottom of the tube .
Incubate for 00:05:00 at room temperature .
Place on magnetic rack and incubate for 00:02:00 or until the beads have pelleted and the supernatant is completely clear .
Carefully remove and discard the supernatant , being careful not to touch the bead pellet .
Add 200 l of room-temperature 70 % volume ethanol to the pellet .
Carefully remove and discard ethanol , being careful not to touch the bead pellet .
go to step # 7 and repeat ethanol wash .
Pulse centrifuge to collect all liquid at the bottom of the tube and carefully remove as much residual ethanol as possible using a P10 pipette .
With the tube lid open incubate for 00:01:00 or until the pellet loses it 's shine ( if the pellet dries completely it will crack and become difficult to resuspend ) .
Resuspend pellet in 30 l Elution Buffer ( EB ) , mix gently by either flicking or pipetting and incubate for 00:02:00 .
Place on magnet and transfer sample to a clean 1.5mL Eppendorf tube ensuring no beads are transferred into this tube .

This is a one-pot ligation protocol for native barcoded ligation libraries .
We have seen no reduction in performance compared to standard libraries , and is made faster by using the Ultra II ligation module which is compatible with the Ultra II end repair/dA-tailing module removing a clean-up step .
Normalise the input by diluting each sample to 1 ng/ L .
Use 5 l input for the One-pot native barcoding reaction to give a total of 5 ng per sample .
Input to the one-pot native barcoding reaction will vary depending on the amplicon length but we have determined 5ng is the correct input for efficient barcoding of this amplicon length .
Process at least 7 samples plus one negative control per native barcoded library in order to have sufficient material at the end .
Set up the following reaction for each sample :
Incubate at room temperature for 00:10:00
Incubate at 65 C for 00:05:00
Incubate on ice for 00:01:00
Add the following directly to the previous reactions :
Use one native barcode from the EXP-NBD104 ( 1-12 ) or EXP-NBD114 ( 13-24 ) per sample .
Use from 6 to 24 barcodes in a library , any fewer and there will be insufficient total material to achieve good yields .
Incubate at room temperature for 00:15:00
Incubate at 70 C for 00:10:00
The 70 C incubation is to inactivate the DNA ligase to prevent barcode cross-ligation when reactions are pooled in the next step .
Pool all barcoded fragments together into a new 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube .
Quantify the barcoded amplicon pools using the Quantus Fluorometer using the ONE dsDNA assay .
Set up the following AMII adapter ligation reaction :
The input of barcoded amplicon pools will depend on the number of barcoded pools and should be between 40 ng ( 8 barcodes ) and 160 ng ( 24 barcodes ) .
Incubate at room temperature for 00:15:00
Add 50 l ( 1:1 ) of SPRI beads to the sample tube and mix gently by either flicking or pipetting .
Vortex SPRI beads thoroughly before use to ensure they are well resuspended , the solution should be a homogenous brown colour .
Incubate for 00:05:00 at room temperature .
Add 200 l SFB and resuspend beads completely by pipette mixing .
SFB will remove excess adapter without damaging the adapter-protein complexes .
Do not use 70 % ethanol as in early clean-ups .
Remove supernatant and discard .
Repeat steps 14-16 to perform a second SFB wash .
Pulse centrifuge and remove any residual SFB .
You do not need to allow to air dry with SFB washes .

MinION sequencing
Prime the flowcell and load 20 ng sequencing library onto the flowcell .
From experience we know 20 ng is optimum loading input for short amplicons .
Thaw the following reagents at room temperature before placing on ice :
Sequencing buffer ( SQB )
Loading beads ( LB )
Flush buffer ( FLB )
Flush tether ( FLT )
Add 30 l FLT to the FLB tube and mix well by vortexing .
If required place a new MinION flowcell onto the MinION by flipping open the lip and pushing one end of the flowcell under the clip and pushing down gently .
Rotate the inlet port cover clockwise by 90 so that the priming port is visible .
Take a P1000 pipette and tip and set the volume to 800 l .
Place the tip in the inlet port and holding perpendicularly to the plane of the flowell remove any air from the inlet port by turning the volume dial anti-clockwise .
Be careful not to remove so much volume that air is introduced onto the rectangular array via the outlet .
Load 800 l of FLB ( plus FLT ) into the flow cell via the inlet port , dispense slowly and smoothly trying to avoid the introduction of any air bubbles .
Wait for00:05:00 .
Gently lift the SpotON cover to open the SpotON port .
Load another 200 l of FLB ( plus FLT ) into the flow cell via the inlet port , this will initiate a siphon at the SpotON port to allow you to load the library dilution .
In a new tube prepare the library dilution for sequencing :
Mix LB immediately before use as they settle quickly .
Dilute library in EB if required .
Mix the prepared library gently by pipetting up and down just prior to loading .
Add the 75 l library dilution to the flow cell via the SpotON sample port in a dropwise fashion .
Ensure each drop siphons into the port before adding the next .
Gently replace the SpotON sample port cover , making sure the bung enters the SpotON port , close the inlet port and close the MinION lid .
Start the sequencing run using MinKNOW .
If required plug the MinION into the computer and wait for the MinION and flowcell to ben detected .
Choose flow cell 'FLO-MIN106 ' from the drop-down menu .
Then select the flowcell so a tick appears .
Click the 'New Experiment ' button in the bottom left of the screen .

Transfer the supernatant to new tubes .
Add 700 l acidic phenol and 200 l chloroform .
Shake the tubes vigourously for 15 seconds and centrifuge for 12000xg for 10 minutes at 4 C .
Following centrifugation the mixture should seperate into three layers : the phenol chloroform phase , an interphase , and an upper aqueous phase .
The RNA remains in the aqueous phase , and if you want to extract DNA later this is in the interphase .
Transfer the aqueous phase into a new 2.0ml tube and add an equal amount of chloroform
Transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5ml tube and add an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol .
Mix well and then leave at -20 C for 2 hours to precipitate .

PCR
The definition used for a satisfactory positive result from a real-time fluorogenic PCR should include each of the following :
A sigmoidal curve the trace travels horizontally , curves upward , continues in an exponential rise and followed by a curve towards a horizontal plateau phase
A suitable level of fluorescence intensity as measured in comparison to a positive control ( y-axis )
A defined threshold ( CT ) value which the fluorescent curve has clearly exceeded ( Fig.1 arrow ) and which sits early in the log-linear phase and is < 40 cycles
A flat or non-sigmoidal curve or a curve that crosses the threshold with a CT value > 40 cycles is considered a negative result
NTCs should not produce a curve
Examples of satisfactory sigmoidal amplification curve shape when considering an assay s fluorescent signal output .
The crossing point or threshold cycle ( CT ) is indicated ( yellow arrow ) ; it is the value at which fluorescence levels surpass a predefined ( usually set during validation , or arbitrary ) threshold level as shown in this normalized linear scale depiction .
LP-log-linear phase of signal generated during the exponential part of the PCR amplification ; TP-a slowing of the amplification and accompanying fluorescence signal marks the transition phase ; PP-the plateau phase is reached when there is little or no increase in fluorescent signal despite continued cycling .

V= volume of TE to add ( uL ) V=n/C
For example , to make 100 uM solution from 69.6 nmoles of oligo , add V=n/C=69.6 nmole / 100 nmole/mL = 0.696 mL = 696uL
More information : This calculation will often be given on the IDT sheet
Resuspension and storage guidelineshttps : //www.idtdna.com/pages/decoded/decoded-articles/core-concepts/decoded/2011/03/16/dna-oligonucleotide-resuspension-and-storageResupension calculatorhttps : //www.idtdna.com/calc/resuspension/ .
Our goal is to make a working solution of primers at 10 uM
Calculations :
V1= volume of 100 uM primers ( uL )
V2= final volume of mixture ( uL )
C1= initial concentration = 100 uM
C2= final concentration = 10 uM
V_TE= amount of 1xTE to add ( uL )
C1*V1= C2*V2
For make 100 uL of 10 uM solution , need V1=C2*V2/C1
= ( 10 uM*100 uL ) / ( 100 uM )
=10 uL of solution C1
We need to calculate the amount of TE to dilute the V1 solution with V2= V1+V_TE V_TE=V2-V1 = 100 - 10 uL =90 uL
Therefore , we 'll combine 10 uL of 100 uM primers with 90 uL TE to create our 10 uM primer mix .

Vibrio natriegens - DNA transformation by electroporation
Use overnight culture corresponding to 1/100 of total media volume ( For example , if you transform 6 samples you 'll need a 600uL of overnight culture to inoculate 60ml media total ) .
Wash the cells as follows : Transfer the appropriate volume in eppendorf tube .
Pellet cells at max centrifuge speed for 1 minuteDispense supernatant
Resuspend cell pellet with same volume ( i.e. , 600uL ) using fresh LB3 growth media .
Use the washed overnight cells to inoculate the appropriate volume of media and incubate the culture at 37C at 225rpm for 1 hour or until culture reaches OD600 ~ 0.4
Use a baffled flask with total volume greater than 2x the media ( For example , use a 250mL flask for up to 100mL culture ) .
In the meantime , prepare electrocuvettes with 50ng of plasmid DNA and place on ice .
DNA volumen should not exceed 10ul .
Also prepare 10mL of cold 1M sorbitol , chilled to 4C and placed on ice .

Colony PCR ( DreamTaq ) with Synechocystis sp . PCC 6803 and gel electrophoresis
Inoculate 50 l sterile water in a tube with your desired colony
It would be good if you use cell-material from a agar plate with an applied clone from an agar plate , so you have enough cell-material
The inoculated water should have a fresh , light green colour
Work under sterile conditions if you need your colonies on your agar plates for a further use .
Heat your samples up to 95 C for 10 minutes
Make sure that you do n't burn yourself ! The samples are hot ! .
Centrifuge your samples at 13,000 rpm for 1 minute .
Pipette 1-2 l of the supernatant into a fresh PCR tube
You can freeze the rest of your samples ( including the pallet ) at -20 C for a further use .
Afterwards just thaw your sample by room temperature and centifuge it at 13,000 rpm for 1 min .
Now you can pipette 1-2 l of the supernatant again for a later colony PCR .
Pipette your master mix .
In this case , we use the Dream Taq DNA Polymerase Kit from Thermo Fisher Science
Use the following contents for one sample:10x DreamTaq buffer : 2 ldNTP Mix : 0.4 lForward primer : 2 lReverse primer : 2 lDreamTaq DNA Polymerase : 0.2 lWater ( nuclease-free ) : 12.4 l ( for 1 l template ) or 12.3 l ( for 2 l template ) Total : 18-19 lPipette the Dream Taq DNA Polymerase in the end
You can also use the Thermo Fisher DreamTaq Master Mix , which contains the buffer , dNTP Mix and the Dream Taq Polymerase .
In this case , you just have to pipette The Master Mix , the forward primer , the reverse primer .
the template DNA and nuclease-free water .
Use the related protocol from your DreamTaq PCR package leaflet .
Pipette 18-19 l of your master mix to your template DNA , which contains 1-2 l ( from the previous steps )
Run a PCR with your samples
Check the Tm of your primers to use the right annealing temperature .
The DreamTaq Polymerase uses the annealing temperature which is 5 C lower than your Tm
Therefore I use a temperature that is 5 C lower than my lowest primer Tm .
For example : My lowest Tm is 63 C .
Therefore I use 58 C as my annealing temperature
You can also check your optimal annealing temperature with various mathematical equations or the Thermo Fisher Tm calculator
https : //www.thermofisher.com/de/de/home/brands/thermo-scientific/molecular-biology/molecular-biology-learning-center/molecular-biology-resource-library/thermo-scientific-web-tools/tm-calculator.htm
In my case I use the following PCR protocol
1 . Initial denaturation : 98 C - 2 min
2 . Denaturation : 98 C - 30 sec .
3 . Annealing : Tm - 5 C - 30 sec - > I use 58 C here
4 . Extension : 72 C - 1 min .
5 . Final extension : 72 C - 10 min
6 . 4 C holdRerun the second to forth step for 35 times
Note from Thermo Fisher : The recommended extension step is 1 min .
for PCR products up to 2kb .
For longer products , the extension time should be prolonged by 1 min/kb .
Prepare an appropriate gel for gel electrophoresis
I prepare an 1 % , small agarose gel .
Therefore put 0.5g of agarose in 50ml 1x TAE ( TRIS-Acetat-EDTA ) buffer
Afterwards heat it up in a microwave with 360 watt until the agarose is completely dissolved and the solution is clear
Cool it down at room temperature until it 's hotter than lukewarm but still touchable and not burning your skin
Shake it some times while it 's cooling down and check the solution for lump formation .
It should be clear ! Add your dye to your agarosegel.I use midoriGreen Advance with an 1:20,0000 dilution factor
Therefore I pipette 2.5 l in my agarose gel solution
Afterwards pour your prepared agarose gel in a gel carrier
Do n't forget to put your appropriate gel combs in your agarose gel before it hardens
When your gel is hardened , take out your gel combs and put appropriate buffer in the gel chamber until the agarose gel is completely soaked .
Load your samples with an appropriate loading dye .
I use the 6x loading dye of Thermo Fisher
Therefore I pipette 4 l to each sample .
Pipette your samples carefully up and down to mix your samples with the loading dye
Load your hardened agarosegel with your samples .
Adjust the loading volume to the size of your gel comb
Do n't forget to use an appropriate ladder for your samples
I use the Gene Ruler 1kb Plus DNA ladder ( ready to use ) to detect a fragment of a size of 708 bp
Therefore I pipette 5 l of my ladder in one slot of the agarose gel .
Run your gel with your desired voltage .
I use 120 V
Adjust your running time to your fragment size
I run my gel until it reaches 2/3 of the gel .
Check your results with your imaging system
I use the ChemyDoc MP System of Bio-Rad to check my gel for my fragments
I use midoriGreen Advance to dye my fragments in the agarose gel
Therefore I use the Nucleic Acid Gels - > GelGreen channel in my Image Lab 5.0 software
Good luck ! .

Laboratory for Integrative Neuroscience Immunofluorescence Protocol
Fix brain via perfusion with 4 % freshly prepared and filtered formaldehyde in Phosphate-Buffered Saline ( PBS ) .
Rinse vasculature first with 37C PBS , then perfuse formaldehyde .
Post fix overnight-BUT NOT LONGER than 12 hrs- in ~10 volumes of 4 % formaldehyde at 4C .
Wash at least 1hr in PBS before sectioning .
See video from the Shain lab linked below .
https : //www.jove.com/video/3564/whole-animal-perfusion-fixation-for-rodents .
Vibratome section at 40 m and collect in a 24-well culture plate in PBS , treadmilling after 6 wells back to the first well .
It will take ~180-200 coronal sections to section from olfactory bulbs to the nigra .
If you need to cut past nigra/VTA , like locus coeruleus , you will have to cut the brain in half or use the cryostat .
Agarose ( 2 % ) helps with this but isn t usually necessary .
It also tends to bind antibodies if not removed .
Save sections in PBS at 4C until ready to use .
Ideally , use within a few days , otherwise , you will need to freeze in cryoprotectant or at 4C with 0.01 % sodium azide in PBS .
Prolonged storage frequently increases autofluorescence .
Wrap in foil if the brains contain fluorescent protein or tracers .
Dispose of sodium azide according to institution regulations if used .
Select columns to stain and place into PBS in the staining well .
The number of columns that you choose depends on the region that you want to sample .
If you just want to check expression , one well from 2-3 mice is sufficient ( 1/6 series )
For smaller regions , every other or every third section may be required for adequate sampling .
Around 25-30 sections/well ( in ~500 L ) is typical in a 24-well plate so use the smaller plates to conserve antibody .
Paint brushes are great for moving sections to new wells for staining and you can combine columns in 12-well trays ( ~800 L ) .
Optional .
Incubate 2 x 5 min with 5 mg/mL NaBH4 in water to quench autofluorescence .
You will need to do this if tissue has been stored for longer than ~1 month .
Wash twice with PBS .
This step is easier in larger wells or with net cup inserts ( EM Sciences ) because the sections float more in the borohydride bubbles .
Optional Step 13 to block lipid fluorescence can also be performed here .
Carefully remove and replace PBS with PBST ( 0.2 % Triton X-100 ) and incubate for at least 1 hr .
A pipet tip attached to a plastic transfer pipet works well for removing solutions .
Avoid touching the tissue with suction because this will rip the sections .
Block with 5 % Bovine Serum Albumin ( BSA ) prepared in PBST for 4 hr to overnight .
500 L/well is sufficient in a 24-well tray .
Overnight incubations should be on an orbital shaker in the cold .
Sometimes it may be necessary to block with the serum ( 0.5 % + 5 % BSA ) from the species in which the secondary antibody was created ( usually goat or donkey ) .
If the antibodies are good , BSA is fine and generally gives less background autofluorescence than serum .
Remove BSA solution and replace with primary antibody prepared in PBST .
For example , chicken anti-GFP , 1:2000 ( 0.5 L/mL ) .
Manuscripts citing this protocol should list the antibodies and concentrations used for the specific experiments.Incubate overnight-72 hrs at 4C on the orbital shaker .
Shorter incubations are possible but antibody penetration may suffer .
If you have to choose , dilute the primary more and incubate longer as opposed to a higher concentration for a shorter time .
Wash at least 3 x 30 minutes with PBST on the oribital shaker at room temperature .
Longer washes are always better .
Add the species appropriate Alexa-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in PBST and incubate overnight at 4C on an orbital shaker .
For example , use AF488 goat anti-chicken for the GFP antibody .
It is possible to incubate all day but , again , penetration and signal suffer .
We can image AF350/DAPI , AF405 , AF488 , AF555 , AF568 , and AF633/647 on the Axiozoom .
The LSM880 will image AFs 405 , 488 , 543 , 555 , 568 , 633 , 647 , and has 2P tunable 720-1100 nm excitation .
Use 760 nm for 2P excitation of DAPI and AF350 .
DAPI will also excite with the 405 nm laser .
Wrap in foil to protect from light after adding the secondary antibodies .
Wash 3 x 30 mins .
DAPI ( 1:20,000 of the 5 mg/mL stock ; 0.5 L into 10 mL of PBST ) can be added in the first wash .
Collect DAPI waste in the appropriate chemical waste container .
Alternatively , you may also use ToPro-3 ( dilute 1:20,000 ) for staining nuclei in far red ( 647 nm ) channel .
If using suspected mutagens like DAPI , wash a few extra times .
Wear gloves and clean well .
Some mounting media contain the DNA stain
These tend to increase background and expose the sections and user to more dye than necessary .
Optional here or after NaBH4 Step # 5 .
Block myelin fluorescence by incubating 2 x 5 mins with filtered 0.1 % Sudan Black in 70 % EtOH .
Wash once with water , then three times for 15 minutes with PBST before continuing to the next step .
Increase Triton concentration 2-fold if destaining is not sufficient or destain overnight .
This step is best performed in a 6 or 12 well tray since the sections tend to stick together in the presence of ethanol .
Mount sections in order from PBS onto Superfrost plus slides .
Adding a few drops of PBS , ordering the sections in the PBS , and then spreading them with paintbrushes is the easiest method for some .
Others prefer to slide sections onto the slides from a petri dish or PBS .
Carefully blot excess PBS and allow sections to dry upright long enough to stick ( ~ 3-5 mins ) but do not over-dry .
This will cause autofluorescence .
Avoid the far right portion of the slide because the slide holders on the higher power scopes obscure this end of the slide .
Use ~ 3 drops of Fluoromount and seal with Sally Hansen Extreme Wear nail polish .
Use # 1.5 coverslips for the Zeiss microscopes .
Image every section on the Axiozoom at low power ( 11-16x or tiled from multiple 100x images ) to document- generally 27 snaps and it will take ~30 minutes .
If you don t see a signal on the Axiozoom at 250x , you may still see one on the Axiovert so check !
Finally , image on confocal for high power or tiling of high power images above 10x , if needed .
You can select regions to image from the axiozoom images .
Save everything in the original Zeiss format .
This saves all of the metadata such as exposure times , objective/zoom , scaling , and filters .
You can export later from Zen or Fiji on your desktop
Helpful Hints If you need to store slides for a long time , store slides at 4C in sealed , humidified slide boxes in a plastic bag or they will dry out over time
It is possible to use pre-made formaldehyde but it will likely give you autofluorescence .
Freshly prepared according to our lab protocol is best .
NEVER use formalin
It is possible to drop fix brains until ~PN21 for 24 hr , beginning at 37C and transferring to 4C .
This is not ideal but is often the only option for very young mice where perfusion would be difficult and mice do not respond to anesthesia .
Expect strong yellow-green autofluorescence in the vasculature to appear with storage .
Use a small natural hair or teklon paint brush to transfer and mount sections .
Michaels has good ones in the craft section .
Brain sections stick to cheap plastic so try a few until you find the best brand
~800 L of PBS per well is sufficient to collect the sections for storage in a 24-well tray .
If the wells are too full , it is difficult to remove without disturbing the slices .
Surface tension holds the sections best at ~500 L
Squirt bottles are great for PBS and PBST washes .
Titrate antibodies when they first arrive and every new lot that you receive .
Take a few sections from the area of interest and put them into 4 different wells .
Dilute the antibody at the suggested concentration , half , and twice .
For example , 1:1000 or 1 g/mL is suggested .
Do 1:500 , 1:1000 , and 1:2000 + a negative control .
Use a well-characterized secondary at the standard concentration ( i.e . 1:1000 for AF488 goat anti-rabbit )
The most common background and lack of specificity problems are caused by using too much antibody
Less is more , especially if you plan to quantify something .
If in doubt , 2 different antibodies against 2 different regions of the protein can help resolve things .
Do them together in 2 different colors .
If GFP is the issue , stain it red with an antibody
Some antigens require heating in 10 mM sodium citrate , pH 6 ( 95C for 10 mins with slow cooling on the bench ) .
In my experience , nuclear antigens and proteins in large complexes may require antigen retrieval
There are ways to amplify the signal , such as TSA and avidin-biotin .
Both have issues in the striatum and require extra controls and blocking steps .
If the experiment is a multi-label and everything colabels perfectly , then you probably did something wrong .
Check your secondary antibody species .
If using a goat primary , all secondaries must be in donkey .
This is a common mistake
Too much of any secondary antibody will stain somthing , particularly in hippocampus and cortex .
Dilute the secondary antibody two fold and see if it goes away in the negative control while still detecting your real signal
Anti-mouse secondaries sometimes pick up blood vessels because of the endogenous mouse immunoglobulins .
The control will show what s artifact .
AF647 donkey anti-mouse recognizes blood vessels in B6 mice but not all secondary antibodies react with B6 immunoglobulins .
Jackson Immunolabs has some isotype-specific secondaries if you really need them but the antibody companies rarely tell you which mouse IgG isotype or strain was used for the immunizing antigen .
Sometimes they are a mixture .
It is possible to purchase mouse blocking kits , such as `` Mouse on Mouse '' but these have not proven particularly useful in our labMonoclonal antibodies ( rabbit , mouse , rat ) will increase specificity but sometimes produce a lower signal than a polyclonal because they only recognize one epitope
Sudan Black ( 0.1 % in 70 % EtOH , 2 x 10 mins ) can be used to quench mounted slides that have accumulated autofluorescence during storage .
Destain in a Coplin jar overnight .
A Pap pen will hold Sudan Black on the slide during the incubation
Older animals are terrible for fluorescence because of lipofuscin .
Less than 90 days is best .
If you have to use older animals , be sure to do controls .
This is especially important for punctate and intracellular antigens , or high power imaging .
If it s lipofuscin , it will fluoresce in more than one channel .
It will also be present in the no primary control
It s better to start with a nice specimen than to try to make a poorly fixed section with background look pretty .
If you have to do a lot of post hoc image enhancement , start over
Think about what you re seeing before you believe it .
Is it a receptor inside of a cell or on the surface where it should be ? .
A peptide that doesn t stain terminals ? .
A transporter clearly associated with a nucleus ? .
Something that looks like a Nissl stain in the hippocampus ? .
Is it where it s supposed to be in the brain ? .
In the correct proportion ?
Look at the whole brain .
This is particularly important when doing virus injections because many transport due to damage to fibers en passant , or via projections to the injected region and retrograde transport back to source
Injections into amygdala sometimes label projections to auditory thalamus because the needle passes through the auditory cortex .
Sometimes it doesn t matter , but injections into mice are extremely variable and need to be verified .
See Kupferschmidt at al. , 2015 for an easy way to do this in tissue after ex-vivo experiments .
Thin sections are best but you can stain thick sections after optogenetic experiments
Multi-labels take a lot of thought and a lot of species .
Mouse , rabbit , chicken , guinea pig , goat , and rat all work .
DO CONTROLS and different combinations/species/antibodies before believing colocalization .

Culture of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ; f.2019-nCoV )
Cell culture tubes were moved from the 37 C incubator to a Class II Biosafety cabinet , within a PC3 laboratory environment .
Growth medium from previously prepared Vero E6 tubes was discarded to waste .
Clinical samples were prepared by diluting in Opti-Mem reduced serum growth medium without foetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and filtering through a 0.2 M , 13 mm Acrodisc filter ( Bio-Strategy Laboratory Products , Australia ) .
150-200 L of filtered patient material was inoculated onto separate confluent cell monolayers along with a negative control tube ( 150-200 L of Opti-Mem alone ) .
NOTE : Fresh specimens are best for succesful viral culture .
Samples were absorbed onto cells by incubating tubes for 1 hr at 37 C before cultures were re-fed with 2 mL of pre-warmed ( 37 C ) Opti-Mem reduced serum growth medium .
NOTE : It can be informative to collect a 200 L sample at this point as a Day 0 value to test alongside other culture samples from Day 2 onwards .
Cultures were incubated for 2-7 days until signs of cytopathic effect ( CPE ) was observed .
In our hands , cultures that were inoculated with patient sample extracts which , at original testing produced CTs of approximately 20 cycles , developed signs of CPE within 3 days post-inoculation .
In the event low-levels of the virus were not detected by observation of CPE in the first isolation attempt , negative cell culture supernatants should be further passaged onto fresh Vero E6 monolayers up to 3 times with testing as described in Step 6 .
A cell culture is suspected of hosting virus replication based on the presence of CPE including damage to the monolayer , cell-clearing and morphological changes .
Suspected cultures were further confirmed using the Corman et al . E E and Northill et al .
ORF1ab ORF1ab novel coronavirus reverse-transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction ( RT-rPCRs ) tests .
Samples taken from a suspected culture are expected to contain levels of virus that exceed those present in the original clinical sample so we would expect to see CT values lower than those obtained from testing the original clinical sample extract by RT-rPCRs .
SLOW CULTURES : If the CT value from an extract of the first passage of a SARS-CoV-2 culture is the same or higher ( suggesting a lower viral load ) than the CT value from the RT-rPCR of the original clinical sample , further investigation will be required to ensure the culture has biologically amplified virus .
Consideration should be given to whether such a result is due to the detection of viral remnants from the inoculum rather than virus amplification .

Pouring LB Agar Plates
Measure of pre-mixed LB-agar powder per L of molten agar you d like to make .
The precise mass you measure out will be based on the number of plates you d like to pour .
Transfer the LB-agar powder you ve measured out into an appropriately sized bottle for autoclaving .
We make of agar in bottles and of agar in bottles .
The extra empty volume is necessary to prevent your molten agar from boiling over in the autoclave .
Transfer the sterile water ( in our case ) to the same bottle and swirl to form a medium/agar colloid .
Cover the opening of the bottle with its cap or aluminum foil ( but do not make an air-tight seal ! ) and tape the bottle with autoclave tape .
The autoclave tape will darken during the autoclave process if your sample has spent at least min at .
Use lab tape to label the bottle with your initials , the date , and the bottle contents .
This will clear up any confusion later if your forget your bottle in the autoclave .
Place the gel mix in the autoclave and run on a setting that gets the sample to at least under 20 psi for at least .
The high pressure will prevent your gel mix from boiling over at high temperature .
While your samples are sterilizing in the autoclave , you should prepare your plate pouring station : Find an empty section of lab bench with a working flame
Spray down the bench with a 70 % ethanol solution and wipe down with a paper towel
Count out the appropriate number of plates and stack them on your lab bench
Label the plates with the date and the medium they will contain including the identity of the antibiotic .

Position the flame just to the side of where you ll be pouring your plates - be sure to leave room for your bottle of molten gel mix , a tube rack containing the appropriate antibiotics , and a section for active pouring .
Prepare your antibiotics
Prior to adding your antibiotic to the molten gel mix , you should create a 1000x stock solution .
Prepare a water bath at 60 with sufficient water to submerge ~75 % of the bottle containing your molten gel mixture .
Retrieve your molten agar mix from the autoclave .
Partially submerge your molten gel-mix in the water bath .
Light the flame at the plate pouring station and dilute your antibiotic into your ~ molten gel mix using sterile technique .
Swirl the agar bottle to ensure even distribution of the antibiotic throughout the agar .
Open one plate at a time next to the flame and begin pouring .
Measure your desired amount of agar with a pipete for the first plate to get a good idea of what that volume looks like in your particular plate .
For the remainder of the plates , pour directly from the bottle .
Leave your plates out on the bench to solidify .
Once your plates have solidified and dried , you should test them to make sure the antibiotic functions properly : Take out two plates
On the first plate , streak out a strain that you know to be resistant to the antibiotic
On the second plate , streak out a strain that s not resistant to the antibiotic
Incubate both plates overnight at the appropriate growth temperature and check for growth .
See our sample data section below for positive and negative test results

When agar has set , replace lid , invert plates and store in an air tight bag at 4 C .
Plates should be removed from 4 C at least 1 h before use and placed in 30 C incubator .
To prevent condensation from lid dropping onto agar surface , wipe lids dry with Kimwipe and store plates inverted .
Cell culture of 7721 or HeLa cells
Prepare RPMI 1640 medium ( Gibco , USA ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Hyclone , USA ) and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin ( Gibco , USA ) .
Warm medium to 37 and bring 0.1 % trypsin - ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) to room temperature .
Observe cells under microscope to evaluate cell confluency and presence of cell death .
Aspirate out spent medium when the cells reach approximately 90 % confluency , and wash twice with PBS .
Add 1 ml 0.1 % trypsin-EDTA to 10-cm culture dish , and ensure the entire surface of the dish is covered with 0.1 % trypsin-EDTA .
Incubate the cells at 37 for 2 minute .
Observe cells under the microscope until the cells have been fully detached , then aspirate out the 0.1 % trypsin-EDTA .
Add 5 ml medium to the dish , gently pipet the cells , and harvest the cells by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 5 minutes .
Aspirate out the medium , minding to not disrupt the cell pellet .
Resuspend the cells in 2 ml medium and count with trypan blue .
Seed the cells in 24-well plates at a density of 1x105 cells/500 l .

Diatom Transformation via Bacterial Conjugation
Grow the diatom culture to mid-log phase ( 8.0E6 cells/ml for Phaeodactylum tricornutum grown on L1 medium or 5.0 E7 cell/ml when grown on BG-11 ) .
We have investigated transformation efficiency throughout the growth curve and found these to be the optimal densities .
On the day of transformation , use the overnight culture to inoculate 50 mL of fresh LB+antibiotic , 1:50 dilution , for each planned transformation
Grow to an OD600 of 0.8 1.0 ( 37 C with 270 rpm shaking )
This takes 3 4 hours .
During the 3 4 hours when the E. coli culture is growing , measure the Phaeodactylum tricornutum cell concentration with a FlowCam or haemocytometer to calculate the required volume needed to collect 2.5E8 cells for each transformation .
For each transformation , centrifuge 50 mL of E. coli culture and the required Phaeodactylum tricornutum volume at 4000 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature
Resuspend E. coli pellet in 500 L of SOC medium
Resuspend P. tricornutum pellet in 500 L of L1 medium
Note : The diatom and E. coli cultures should be centrifuged at around the same time to minimize the amount of time they spend concentrated .
In a 1.5 mL tube , mix 200 l of E. coli cells with 200 l of Phaeodactylum tricornutum cells
Negative control : In a 1.5 mL tube , mix 200 l of SOC medium with 200 l of Phaeodactylum tricornutum cells
Note : Incubate and treat the negative control plates identically to conjugation plates
Spread the mixture ( 400 L ) on Conjugation Plates .
( 0.5x BG-11 with 5 % LB and 1 % agar )
The authors of the original protocol suggested spreading the mixture near , but not touching , the edges of the plate , as this mixture will be scraped and replated in 2 days .
Incubate plates for 90 minutes at 30 C in the dark .
Move plates to light incubator ( 18 C and 100 mol photons m-2 s-1 ) for 2 days .
Collect cells by adding 1 mL of L1 medium .
Use a cell scraper to concentrate cells and medium to one side of the plate .
We often add 500 L L1 to collect the majority of the cells from the plate
We then repeat with an additional 500 l L1 to collect the remaining cells
Transfer resuspended cells into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube with a P1000 pipette and filter tips .
Spread 200 l of the cell suspension on a Selection Plate .
Incubate at 18 C and 100 mol photons m-2 s-1 until colonies appear .
After a minimum of 8-12 days , untransformed Phaeodactylum tricornutum cells die off , and colonies of transformed cells begin to appear .
In some cases , this can take 3 4 weeks
Alternatively , selection can be done in liquid BG-11 selection medium using eGFP as a reporter and sorted using FACS.un-transformed PteGFP expression .

60 times Conclusions : It looks like that at 267 kb there is a straight cut off due to the fact that the longer DNA could n't enter the gel , also indicated by the red saturated bits still stuck in the pockets .
As the amount of DNA between 24-48 kb seems to be increasing for bands 2-5 , we think that with longer vortexing times more smaller and smaller fragments are produced .
For bands 6-9 we think that fragmets are also sheared through pipetting but that there is a certain cut off due to the pipette tip size and what length of fragmetns fits through
*pipette tips were cut .
Qiagen QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit ( 28704 and 28706 ) , centrifuge processing
Excise DNA fragment from agarose gel with clean , sharp scalpel .
Weigh the gel slice in a colorless tube .
Maximum amount of gel per column is 400mg ( about 0.4cm3 ) .
Add 3 volumes Buffer QG to 1 volume of gel ( 100mg gel ~ 100 L ) .
For > 2 % agarose gels , add 6 volumes Buffer QG .
Incubate at 50 C for 10 minutes ( or until gel slice has completely dissolved ) .
[ Optional ] : Vortex every 2-3 min to help dissolve gel .
Check color of mixture to ensure it is yellow , similar to Buffer QG without dissolve agarose .
If color is orange or violet , add 10 L of 3M sodium acetate , pH 5.0 , and mix .
For purifying < 500bp or > 4kb , add 1 volume isopropanol to increase yield and mix .
Place a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 ml collection tube .
To bind DNA , apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min then discard flow through .
The maximum volume is 800 L .
For larger volumes , load and spin again .
Return QIAquick column to collection tube .
If the DNA will subsequently be used for sequencing , in vitro transcription , or microinjection , add 500 L Buffer QG to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for one minute .
Discard flow through and return column to collection tube .
To wash , add 750 l Buffer PE to the QIAquick column .
If DNA will be used for salt-sensitive applications ( e.g . sequencing , blunt-ended ligation ) , let column stand for 2-5 minutes
Centrifuge for 1 minute .
Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back in the same tube .
Centrifuge the column for an additional 1 min
IMPORTANT : Residual ethanol from Buffer PE will not be completely removed unless the flow-through is discarded before this additional centrifugation .
Place QIAquick column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube .
To elute DNA , add 50 l Buffer EB ( 10 mM Tris Cl , pH 8.5 ) or water ( pH 7.0 8.5 ) to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min .
Alternatively , for increased DNA concentration , add 30 l elution buffer to the center of the QIAquick membrane , let the column stand for 1 min , and then centrifuge
IMPORTANT : Ensure that the elution buffer is dispensed directly onto the QIAquick membrane for complete elution of bound DNA .
The average eluate volume is 48 l from 50 l elution buffer volume , and 28 l from 30 l elution buffer
Elution efficiency is dependent on pH .
The maximum elution efficiency is achieved between pH 7.0 and 8.5 .
When using water , make sure that the pH value is within this range , and store DNA at 20 C as DNA may degrade in the absence of a buffering agent .
The purified DNA can also be eluted in TE buffer ( 10 mM Tris Cl , 1 mM EDTA , pH 8.0 ) , but the EDTA may inhibit subsequent enzymatic reactions .
If the purified DNA is to be analyzed on a gel , add 1 volume of Loading Dye to 5 volumes of purified DNA .
Mix the solution by pipetting up and down before loading the gel
Loading dye contains 3 marker dyes ( bromophenol blue , xylene cyanol , and orange G ) that facilitate estimation of DNA migration distance and optimization of agarose gel run time .
Refer to Table 2 ( page 15 ) to identify the dyes according to migration distance and agarose gel percentage and type .
Suggested protocol for loading a DNA Ladder/marker
Prepare loading mixture ( 6 l total volume ) : .
Mix gently .
Load onto the agarose gel .

Go back for the rest of the DNA if it broke apart and repeat .
Add 1 ml 70 % ethanol to the Eppendorf .
Spin down at 10,000 xg then remove as much of the 70 % ethanol as possible .
Wash again with 1 ml 70 % ethanol .
Let the remaining ethanol evaporate by leaving at RT for 15 minutes .
Add 100 l EB + Triton-X100 and incubate without mixing at 5 C for 2 days to allow the pellet to fully resuspend into a translucent viscous gel .
Take a P2 pipette set to 1.5 l with a cut-off tip and aspirate very slowly then try to work the DNA in the tip away from the DNA in the tube by continuously pulling and releasing the DNA to work it gradually away .
Adjust the pipette volume to determine the volume of DNA you actually removed .
Quantify the DNA on the Qubit BR assay , the concentration should be > 1 g/ l , it is important to use BR as the buffer contains a detergent which appears to improve mixing .
Check the absorbance spectrum of the 1:10 diluted DNA on the NanoDrop , example trace below ( ratios typically a little higher than other methods ) .
If necessary add more EB+Triton-X100 to the stock DNA to adjust concentration to 1 g/ul but do not mix .
Leave overnight at 5 C before use .
As slowly as you can pipette 16 l DNA into a 0.2 ml PCR tube using a cut-off P20 pipette tip , retain the tip .
Remove 1 l from the tube as before and quantify using Qubit BR assay .
Add 1.5 l FRA and 3.5 l EB+Triton-X100
Using a P20 set to 18 l and the tip from before , mix up and down as slowly as possible 8 times , retain the tip .

Load 800 l flush mix via the inlet port slowly using the plunger .
Wait 5 minutes .
Lift the cover off the SpotON port .
Load 200 l flush mix via the inlet port slowly using the plunger , try to dispense at a speed where a bead of liquid becomes visible over the SpotON port which then gets siphoned back in .
Add 34 l SQT and 20 l NFW to the library tube .
Using a P100 set to 75 l with a cut-off tip mix up and down as slowly as possible 5 times .
On the final mix slowly pipette the diluted library onto the SpotON port as it gets siphoned in , this can take much longer than usual due to the viscosity .

Taxonomic biomarker discovery with LEfSe
Before beginning , we need to convert the sample names into consistent class names .
This can easily be done by manually editing the | '' blocks '' : [ | '' key '' : '' 630rg '' , '' text '' : '' output\/merged_abundance_table.txt '' , '' type '' : '' unstyled '' , '' depth '' :0 , '' inlineStyleRanges '' : [ ] , '' entityRanges '' : [ ] , '' data '' : [ ] } ] , '' entityMap '' : [ ] } generated in the previous protocols or using the following `` sed '' based Unix command : .
The first LEfSe step consists of formatting the input table , making sure the class information is in the first row and scaling the values in [ 0,1M ] which is useful for numerical computational reasons .
Now , the LEfSe biomarker discovery tool can be used with default statistical options .
Here we change one default parameter to increase the threshold on the LDA effect size from 2 ( default ) to 4 .
The results of the operation can now be displayed plotting the resulting list of biomarkers with corresponding effect sizes .
The resulting image ( | '' blocks '' : [ | '' key '' : '' 975lt '' , '' text '' : '' output_images\/lefse_biomarkers.png '' , '' type '' : '' unstyled '' , '' depth '' :0 , '' inlineStyleRanges '' : [ ] , '' entityRanges '' : [ ] , '' data '' : [ ] } ] , '' entityMap '' : [ ] } ) is shown below : .
Another complementary visualization focuses on showing the biomarkers on the underlying taxonomic tree .
The default plotting output is shown here : .
Single features can also be plotted as barplots with | '' blocks '' : [ | '' key '' : '' 25aim '' , '' text '' : '' plot_features.py '' , '' type '' : '' unstyled '' , '' depth '' :0 , '' inlineStyleRanges '' : [ ] , '' entityRanges '' : [ ] , '' data '' : [ ] } ] , '' entityMap '' : [ ] } .
For example , to plot the distribution of abundances for Firmicutes the command is : .
All features ( or all biomarkers ) can also be exported in one compressed archive : .
Here are the resulting figures for Firmicutes and for Veillonellaceae ( extracted from biomarkers.zip ) .

Determine the size distribution of DNA in samples by Agilent 4200 TapeStation analysis
The positive control ( anti-H3K27me3 ) should show a nucleosomal ladder in the 'S ' sample , and a weak high-molecular weight DNA band in the 'PX ' sample
The negative control ( non-specific rabbit IgG ) should show no DNA in the 'S ' sample , and a weak high-molecular weight DNA band in the 'PX ' sample
Most antibodies ( eg to transcription factors ) will show no nucleosomal ladder , but we find that they often have sufficient material for library construction and produce excellent genomic profile

Drosophila embryo collection
Place an apple-agar plate in the embryo collection cage to provide a substrate for egg laying .
Prior to adding the plate , smear a small quantity of yeast paste ( dry yeast mixed with water to a peanut-butter like consistency ) onto the centre of the apple-agar .
The addition of yeast will encourage egg laying .
Water soaked absorbent cotton wool is also added to the cage to provide moisture .
Add fly population to cage and place cage at 25 1 C in a 12 h:12h light : dark cycle for 24 hours .
Check the surface of the apple-agar plate for eggs .
If If there are too few eggs , flies may require a longer habituation period .
Replace with a fresh apple-agar plate , re-soak the cotton wool and leave the fly population in cage for a further 24 hours .
Take egg laden apple-agar plate from the cage and remove remaining yeast paste and any dead flies from the agar surface .
Submerge the apple-agar plate in 1x PBS and gently dislodge eggs from the agar surface with a fine paintbrush most eggs will be found on the outer edge of the agar .
While suspended in PBS , transfer the eggs to a falcon tube and leave for 5 min , allowing the eggs to sink to the bottom of solution .
Cut the bottom 4mm off a p1000 filtered pipette tip , and use this to draw 1 mL of eggy solution , taken from the bottom of the falcon tube .
Transfer this to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and allow to settle .
When drawing up solution a more consistent number of eggs is achieved by snap-releasing the pipette plunger rather than by gentle-release .
Cut the bottom 4 mm off a p20 filtered pipette tip .
Set the pipette to a desired volume and draw this from the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube , again using the snap-release pipetting method .
With practice a consistent number of eggs can be obtained , a volume of 5 L will produce 102 4 eggs .
Dispense collected eggs onto food source and leave to develop until required for experiments .

Mint-ChIP3 : A low-input ChIP-seq protocol using multiplexed chromatin and T7 amplification
Preliminary StepsPrechill microfuge to 4 C
Thaw the chromatin adapters needed per your experimental design and hold on ice
Prepare the following three master mixes and hold on ice , before taking cells from the freezer
a . 2X MNase/Lysis Mastermix : The following yields a 2X lysis buffer with 60 U MNase per 20 ul , which is in routine use in our lab .
We typically make excess MNase/Lysis Mastermix , because the MNase is highly concentrated and thus we avoid handling miniscule amounts of MNase .
The sodium butyrate can be omitted if no acetyl marks are being ChIPed .
The MNase can be used in a range from 30 U to 150 U per 20 ul ; the MNase volume can be adjusted accordingly for lower or higher MNase amounts .
The 100X Protease Inhibitor cocktail stock is made by dissolving 2 Roche 4693132001 tablets in 1 ml of molecular biology grade water .
Store unused 100X stock at 4C and discard unused portion after 2 weeks .
b. T7 Adapter Ligation Mastermix for 8 reactions : When performing 8 reactions , we make sufficient mastermix ( MM ) for 9 reactions , to accommodate any small losses that may occur during pipetting
c. Ligase Quenching Solution [ sufficient for 25 reactions ] : Starting the Protocol
1 . Suspend cells in 20 ul of ice cold PBS ( typically 50K to 100K per antibody in use )
2 . Achieve lysis by adding 20 ul of 2X MNase/Lysis Mastermix , mix by using a few gentle cycles of pipetting
3 . Hold on ice for 20 minutes [ to achieve cell lysis ] .
4 . Transfer to a pre-warmed thermal cycler at 37oC for 10 minutes [ to achieve MNase digestion ]
5 . Immediately place samples on ice and add 4.8 uL of 0.5 M EGTA to each sample [ to stop MNase activity ]
6 . Use 1 uL of digested cells to measure the DNA concentration with the dsDNA Qubit kit
T7 Adapter Ligation
1 . On ice , add 4 uL of 250 uM annealed chromatin adapter to the cell lysate .
The EGTA should protect the dsDNA adapters from residual MNase activity .
If multiplexing distinct chromatin preparations together , be sure to use a different adapter barcode with each to enable subsequent demultiplexing .
The following table summarizes 8 different barcodes we have found perform well ; full adapter sequences and instructions for ordering are attached to this protocol
2 . Add 31.8 uL of T7 Adapter Ligation Mastermix and immediately mix contents well .
The total volume should be about 80 uL at this point
3 . Cover the PCR plate with a foil cover , and incubate at room temperature for 2 hours [ to ligate adapters to chromatin ]
4 . After 2 hours , end the T7 Adapter Ligation reaction by adding 80 uL of the Ligase Quenching Solution ( recipe above ) to each sample .
The total volume should be 160 uL at this point .
The 160 uL is made up of cells , MNase/Lysis buffer mastermix , the T7 Adapter Ligation mastermix , and the Quenching solution
Chromatin Multiplexing ( Optional ) and ChIP Construction : Because each sample has a unique Mint Chromatin Adapter , multiple chromatin samples can optimally be mixed together at this point .
Follow one of the following two procedures to complete Day 1 .
a. Mint-ChIP without Chromatin Multiplexing
1 . If you are using an input control in your experimental design , reserve 3 % of the volume PRIOR to adding antibody .
Hold the input control in a sealed tube at 4 C until Day 2
2 . Add 1-5 uL of antibody of interest to each sample and incubate rotating end over end overnight at 4oC .
Depending on the antibody , the ideal volume of antibody to chromatin ratio will differ , and should be optimized empirically .
We typically find that 1-2 ug of antibody works well for a range of antibodies and cell numbers .
Mint-ChIP With Chromatin Multiplexing
1 . Mix up to 8 samples with distinct barcodes in a 1.5 ml microfuge tube ( we typically use only 2 to 4 barcodes in a mixture )
2 . If you are using an input control in your experimental design , reserve 3 % of the mixture PRIOR to adding antibody .
Hold the input control in a sealed tube at 4 C until Day 2
3 . Whatever the total volume of the mixture , divide it evenly across the number of antibodies in use .
Please see the comment above about the effective cell number per ChIP .
In the case of a pooled sample , the relevant number is the total number of cells per chromatin prep per ChIP , not the total cell number over-all per ChIP .
If the chromatin volume is under 100 ul , we supplement the chromatin with a 1:1 mixture of Ligase Quenching Solution and 1X MNase/Lysis Mastermix with the MNase omitted
4 . Add 1-5 uL of antibody of interest to each sample and incubate rotating end over end overnight at 4oC .
Depending on the antibody , the ideal volume of antibody to chromatin ratio will differ , as described above

1.Protein A/G Bead Binding :
1.Remove Protein A/G Magnetic Beads from 4oC and leave on rotator for ~30 minutes at room temperature so that beads are thoroughly and evenly mixed .
2 . Calculate total Protein A/G bead slurry needed .
The total total slurry needed is equal to 1/10 of the total combined volume of the chromatin - immune complexes ( i.e . 20uL per 200uL chromatin - antibody complex ) .
3.Wash an appropriate volume of Protein A/G beads with two volumes of lysis dilution buffer , by immobilizing beads on magnet , and removal of clear fluid .
Then resuspend the washed beads in the same volume of lysis dilution buffer that was used to wash the beads .
Add washed beads to each sample ( 10 ul of reuspended beads per 100 ul of immune complex ) and incubate on rotator for 1 hour at 4oC
5 . While the samples are incubating , supplement ChIP Elution Buffer with Proteinase K ( 1.25 ul of 20 mg/ml Proteinase K per 100 ul of ChIP Elution Buffer ; we call this CEBPK ) .
You will require 100 ul of CEBPK per ChIP .
Note , CEBPK tends to precipitate SDS if held on ice , so maintain at room temperature until used
2 . ChIP Wash : After the samples have incubated with Protein A/G beads for an hour , the ChIPs are ready to be washed .
When washing , resuspend , magnetize , and aspirate as quickly as possible .
Never leave for more than a minute

Day 3 : Starting with RNA Isolation and ending with Library ConstructionOverview of Day 3 :
1.RNA Isolation with Silane Beads
2.Reverse Transcription ( RNA to cDNA )
3.Library PCR to Enrich Adapter-Modified DNA Fragments
5.Final SPRI Cleanup
1.RNA Isolation with Silane Beads :
1.Remove Silane Beads and SPRI Beads from 4 C and incubate on a rotator for at least 30 minutes at room temperature , or until beads are thoroughly and evenly mixed .
Add 1 uL of DNase to IVT RNA samples and incubate at 37 C for 15 minutes
3 . Using a 96 well plate , magnetize 20 uL of Silane Bead suspension per IVT reaction .
Remove clear supernatant , and wash with four volumes of RLT Buffer ( i.e . 80 uL RLT for 20 uL of beads ) , and resuspend washed beads in 4 volumes of RLT
4 . Transfer 60 uL of the washed beads to the 20 uL IVT reaction .
The 60 uL will contain 15 uL of beads which will bind up to 3 ug of RNA .
The remaining 20 ul of beads is discarded .
Incubate at room temperature for 1 minute
5.Add 48 uL of 100 % ethanol and mix well by pipettinga .
Wait for 2.5 minutes , mix , and wait an additional 2.5 minutes ( for a total of 5 minutes ) .
6.Magnetize the platea .
Remove and discard the supernatant once the solution looks clear .
The RNA is adsorbed to the beads .
Wash with 200 uL of FRESH 75 % ethanola .
Mix by moving the plate from the center of the magnet to off center of the magnet .
Leave on the magnet for 1 minute and then remove the ethanol
8.Wash AGAIN with 200 uL of FRESH 75 % ethanol
a.You will see the beads move from one side of the well to the other side of the well
b . Leave on the magnet for 1 minute and then remove the ethanolc .
It is critical to wash thoroughly to eliminate all DNase prior to the reverse transcription step
9 . Air-dry at room temperature for 2 minutes .
Make sure not to over dry .
10.Elute RNA with 9 uL TE
a.Remove plate from magnet and resuspend beads in 9 uL TE .
Make sure to get all the beads off the sides of the wells
b.Let rest for 1 minute off the magnet and then 2 minutes on the magnetc .
Once the beads are on the sides of the wells , remove and SAVE the supernatant ; it is your IVT RNA prep .
11 . OPTIONAL : Measure 2 ul on RNA Qubit
a.If below detection limit ( 4 ug/ml ) , the libraries are likely to be very low in complexity
b . Total amount of RNA should be higher than input DNA for IVT reaction ; typically the yield of RNA is 50 ng to 100 ng
2 . Reverse Transcription ( RNA - > cDNA ) :
1 . Combine IVT RNA with random primer and annealing buffer and incubate mixture at 65 C for 5 minutes on the thermocycler , then immediately cool to 4 C in the thermal cycler ( i.e . ramp as fast as the instrument will allow ) .
Once the program cools to 4oC , remove the plate and place immediately on ice , for at least one minute .
3 . Supplement the primer annealed IVT RNA with the master mix described below and return the plate to the thermal cycler .
The thermal profile should be as follows : 10 minutes at 25oC 50 minutes at 50oC 5 minutes at 85oC 4oC indefinite
We employ a single PCR program with a pause in the middle to accomplish both the annealing and elongation steps .
At the conclusion of the cDNA synthesis step , add 1 uL RNase to each sample , mix thoroughly , and incubate at 37oC for 15 minutes in a PCR machine , then return to 4C .
At this point , you have eliminated the IVT RNA , and should only have cDNA
3 . 1X SPRI Cleanup :
1.Add 68 uL of water to cDNA so that the volume is easier to work with manually .
The total volume is now 100 ul per well .
Add 100 uL of SPRI Beads ( suspended at the start of Day 3 ) and mix by pipetting
a.Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes
3.Magnetize plate for 5 minutes so that the beads separate out
a.Remove and discard the supernatant

7.Elute cDNA in 24.5 uL TE
a.Remove plate from magnet and resuspend beads in 24.5 uL TE .
Once the beads are on the sides of the wells , remove and SAVE the supernatant ; it is your cDNA .
Use 1 ul of cDNA to measure cDNA concentration with ssDNA Qubit ( this is not optional , as will be apparent immediately below ) .
4 . Library PCR to Enrich Adapter-Modified DNA Fragments : We put a maximum of 200 ng of cDNA into the PCR , so if the yield of cDNA exceeds 200 ng , then the cDNA needs to be diluted prior to PCR .
Using more than 200 ng input cDNA impairs the yield of DS DNA with suitable ends for Illumina sequencing .
If the yield of cDNA is under 200 ng , we use the entire 200 ng volume in the PCR reaction .
If the yield of cDNA exceeds 200 ng , remove the appropriate volume of cDNA ( containing up to 200 ng ) and add it to Elution Buffer so that the combined volume sums to 22.5 ul .
Prepare the following PCR enrichment reaction and place on thermal cycler for the following times and temperatures :
5.Post PCR Final SPRI Cleanup :
1.Add 50 uL of molecular biology grade water and check that the volume is exactly 100 uL
2.Add 60 uL of SPRI beads ( 0.60 ) and mix by pipetting .
The beads will bind DNA fragments of > 700 bp .
The purpose of this step is to remove these large fragments .
a.Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes
3.Magnetize plate for 5 minutes to separate the beads out
a.After 5 minutes , transfer the supernatant ( about 160 uL ) to clean plate wells .
The supernatant should contain DNA fragments of < 700 bp .
It is your library , now cleared of high molecular weight fragments .
4.Add 35 uL of SPRI beads ( 0.95 ) and mix by pipetting .
The beads will bind to DNA fragments of > 200 bp , thus excluding unincorporated PCR primers , which remain in solution .
a.Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes
5.After 5 minutes , remove and discard the supernatant
6.Leave on the magnet for 1 minute and then remove the ethanol
7.Air-dry at room temperature for 5 minutes
9.Elute DNA in 40 uL Elution Buffer .

How to make your protocol more reproducible , discoverable , and user-friendly
Title : Try to make your title descriptive , as you would for a manuscript .
This helps for searches on Google & protocols.io .
Thumbnail Picture : Having a picture to identify the protocol helps you and other users find it in the lists of protocols they use .
Groups : You can add your protocol to any relevant groups that you joined so that the members of these groups will receive a notification and be able to look at your protocol .
It will enable you to show your protocol to the right audience .
Keywords : When enter your protocol , you can add keywords on the 'description ' tab .
The keywords will be visible under the 'matadata ' tab of you protocol and your protocol will appear in the search results for queries with these keywords .
Components : For each step you can add any of these components to provide the important details , by clicking on one of the boxes on the right side : .
Wetlab Components : Specifying the reagents and equipment with vendor names , catalog numbers , links , RRID , etc . is crucial .
Just naming the antibody you used is not enough , as vendor-to-vendor and even lot-to-lot variability can make or break the experiment .
Use the 'reagent ' component inside steps or in the 'materials ' section .
Bioinformatics Components : Use the `` command '' , `` software package '' , `` dataset '' , and `` external link '' components to specify the code , version of software , and location/version of the datasets used in the analysis .
Pictures/Videos : You can add pictures or videos for any step of your protocol ( or in the guidelines ) .
This often makes all the difference when someone is trying your method for the first time .
When doing an experiment , the protocols on this platform can be followed step-by-step on the web or on our iOS and Android apps .
Single Step Instructions : Break up the method details into recipe-like checklist format .
Instead of `` incubate for 4min , then centrifuge at RT for 5min '' separate as follows : .
Repeated Steps : Instead of `` wash 3 times '' or `` repeat steps 8-13 '' , spell out the individual steps
Be concise : Too much text in the instruction step makes it hard to follow .
Move comments and tips to the `` annotation '' component .
Timed steps : Use the `` Duration/Timer '' component in the individual steps as appropriate .
This makes it possible to use the timer when `` running '' your protocol
Running the protocol : .
Sections : Group related steps together into sections by giving sequential steps the same `` section title '' .
Guidelines , warnings , before start : Use the `` Guidelines & Warnings '' tab for adding `` before strart '' instructions , warnings .
Also in `` Guidelines & Warnings '' tab is the `` Guidelines '' field for information about the method , references , tips , etc as well as an option to lable the protocol as confidential or containing sensetive content .
Safety : In the `` Guidelines & Warnings '' tab there is a `` Safety Warings '' field .
You can also add step-level safety information for specific reagents and equipment using the `` Safety information '' component .
It 's good to be redundant with these warnings , so consider putting them into relevants steps , `` warnings '' , and Guidelines .
