Protocol for transfection of H4, (ATCC : HTB-148) Cells by FuGENE HD in 96 well plates.
Cell plating H4 (neuroglioma) cells were seeded from 90-100 % confluent culture the day before transfection with the density 7,000 cells/well in 100 l complete growth medium (DMEM + 10 % Fetal Bovine Serum).
For transfection in 100 % Fetal Bovine Serum the complete growth medium was replaced with Fetal Bovine Serum two hours before transfection.
Complex preparation (per 20 wells).
Tissue culture 96-round bottom well plates were used for complex preparation : Prepare 0.02 g/ l pCMV DNA solution in OptiMEM or sterile deionized water.
Add 6 l of reagent to 100 l of DNA solution.
Mix carefully by pipetting (15 times).
Incubate 10 min at room temperature.
Add 5 l of complex per well to the cells, and mix thoroughly.
Incubation.
Incubate transfected cells in CO2 incubator for 48 hours.
Detection of -gal expression.
Remove the medium from the well and wash the cells once with 100 l per well PBS.
Fix the cells in the well with 50 l solution of 4 % formaldehyde in PBS for 5min at room temperature.
Wash each well twice with 100 l PBS.
Add 50 l per well of substrate/stain solution and incubate the plate overnight at 37 C.
Observe the cells under microscope and evaluate the proportion of blue (-gal-positive) cells.
