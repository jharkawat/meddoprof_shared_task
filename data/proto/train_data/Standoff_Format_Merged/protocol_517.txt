Mix well by pipetting up and down.
Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes.
Add 5 l of the KLD mix from the `` KLD Section '' above to 50 l of chemically-competent cells.
Carefully flick the tube 4-5 times to mix.
Do not vortex.
Place the mixture on ice for 30 minutes.
Heat shock at 42 C for 30 seconds.
Place on ice for 5 minutes.
Pipette 950 l of room temperature SOC into the mixture.
Incubate at 37 C for 60 minutes with shaking (250 rpm).
Mix the cells thoroughly by flicking the tube and inverting.
Spread 40 100 l onto appropriate selection plate.
Incubate overnight at 37 C
