* Tube 3 will contain cells that receive Primary Antibody.
- Note : if this is the first time running this experiment, optimize by using different dilutions of primary antibody.
More tubes containing sample will be needed.
Wash cells by adding 1 ml cold PBS, then gently centrifuge at 4 C.
Carefully remove supernatant and discard.
Gently resuspend cells in 100 l of the appropriate diluted antibody as outlined above.
Incubate cells on ice for at least 1 hour.
Wash cells as above.
Gently resuspend cells in 100 l Secondary Antibody in diluent buffer, and incubate for 1 hour on ice.
Wash cells as before.
Resuspend cell pellet in 400 l of diluent buffer.
Run cells through the flow cytometer.
