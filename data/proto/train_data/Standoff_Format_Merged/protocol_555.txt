Methyltransferase Assay
Set up the assays, to contain 50.0 L total per assay with 3 g of DNA and 2 Ci of Adenosyl-L-Methionine, S-Methyl (3H), and the enzyme to be tested.
Incubate the assays at 37 C for 2 hours.
Add 30 L (60 g) of proteinase K to each assay.
Incubate at 65 C for 20 min.
Add 4 L (20 g) of ss salmon sperm DNA as a carrier.
Add an equal volume (84 L) of 20 % TCA and incubate at 4 C for 10 min to precipitate the samples.
Centrifuge the assays in the microfuge for 5 min at 4 C.
Discard the supernatants.
Wash the pellets 2X with 200 L of 5 % TCA in the microfuge for 5 min at 4 C.
Resuspend the pellets with 500 L each of 500 mM NaOH.
Incubate the assays at 65 C for 20 min.
Precipitate the samples with 500 L of 20 % TCA for 10 min at 4 C.
Centrifuge the samples in the microfuge for 5 min at 4 C.
Wash the pellets 2X with 200 L of 5 % TCA in the microfuge for 5 min at 4 C.
Resuspend the pellet with 500 L of 5 % TCA.
Incubate in boiling water for 30 min (loosen the caps or puncture the caps of the tubes).
Centrifuge the samples in the microfuge for 5 min at 4 C to remove the insoluble material.
Count the supernatants in 10 mL of triton-toluene counting solution.
