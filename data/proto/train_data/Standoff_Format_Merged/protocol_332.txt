OmniPrep For High Quality Genomic DNA Extraction From Blood
To < 500 l whole blood, buffy coat, bone marrow or packed cells in a 2ml microfuge tube, add 0.75ml Nuclei Isolation Buffer.
Centrifuge at ~14,000g for 30 seconds to pellet the whole blood cells and nuclei.
Vortex to resuspend the pellet and add 0.75ml Nuclei Isolation Buffer.
Centrifuge at ~14,000g for 30 seconds to pellet the nuclei.
Incubate the sample at 55-60 C for 15 minutes.
Do not heat higher than 60 C.
OPTIONAL : For maximum DNA recovery, add 1 l Proteinase K solution for every 100 l Lysis Buffer and incubate at 60 C for 1-2 hours.
Invert the tube periodically each hour.
This step will digest hard to handle tissues and significantly improve the yield.
Allow the sample to cool to room temperature.
Add 200 l chloroform and mix by inverting the tube several times.
Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 14,000xg and carefully remove the upper phase to a clean microcentrifuge tube.
Add 50 l DNA Stripping Solution to the sample and invert several times to mix.
Incubate the sample for 5-10 minutes at 60 C.
Add 100 l Precipitation Solution and mix by inverting the tube several times.
Centrifuge the sample at 14,000xg for 5 minutes.
Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube and precipitate the genomic DNA with 500 l isopropanol.
Invert the tubes 10 times to precipitate the DNA.
OPTIONAL : For increased DNA recovery, add 2 l Mussel Glycogen as a DNA carrier.
Centrifuge at 14,000xg for 5 minutes to pellet genomic DNA.
Remove the supernatant.
Add 700 l 70 % ethanol to the tube and invert several times to wash the DNA pellet.
Centrifuge for 1 minute at 14,000xg.
Decant or pipette off the ethanol wash.
Invert the tube on a clean absorbent surface for several minutes to allow any excess ethanol to drain away.
Add 50 l TE Buffer to the pellet.
Incubate at room temperature for at least 15 minutes to rehydrate.
OPTIONAL : 1 l LongLife RNase for every 100 l TE Buffer can be added at this stage.
Store DNA at 4 C, for long term storage store at -20 C or -80 C.
Invert to mix and incubate at room temperature for 1 minute, invert at least twice during incubation.
Remove the supernatant containing lysed red blood cells, retaining the pellet.
Invert tube to mix and then incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature, inverting the tube every 1-2 minutes.
Remove the supernatant and retain the white nuclei pellet with 10-20 l supernatant.
Vortex to resuspend the pellet for improved nuclear lysis and add 500 l Genomic Lysis Buffer.
Mix by pipetting or vortexing at high speed for 10 seconds.
