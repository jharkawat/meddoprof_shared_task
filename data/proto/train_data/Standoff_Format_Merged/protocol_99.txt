PCR with Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (M0492)
Set up the following reaction on ice : Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix, 12.5 l, 25 l, 1X ; 10 M, Forward Primer, 1.25 l, 2.5 l, 0.5 M ; 10 M, Reverse Primer, 1.25 l, 2.5 l, 0.5 M ; Template DNA variable variable < 1,000 ng Nuclease-Free Water, to 25 l, to 50 l.
Gently mix the reaction.
Collect all liquid to the bottom of the tube by a quick spin if necessary and overlay the sample with mineral oil if using a PCR machine without a heated lid.
Quickly transfer PCR tubes to a thermocycler preheated to the denaturation temperature (98 C).
