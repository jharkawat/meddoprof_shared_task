Treg Polarization of Mouse CD4+ Cells
Harvest lymph nodes (superficial cervical, mandibular, axillary, inguinal, and mesenteric) from mice.
Tease lymph nodes through a sterile 70- m nylon cell strainer to obtain single-cell suspensions incomplete RPMI containing 10 % FCS (complete medium).
Resuspend cells in complete medium and use your favorite method to isolate CD4+cells.

Plate CD4+cells at 1.0 x 106/1ml/well.
Culture cells for 5 days at 37 C, 5 % CO2, in the presence ofanti-mouse CD28, clone 37.51 (3 g/mL), recombinant mouse IL-2 (5 ng/mL), and recombinanthuman TGF- 1 (5 ng/ml).
On day 3, if media is yellow, add 2 ml/well of fresh media.
On day 5, after harvesting, the cells are ready for staining.
On day 0, coat 12-well plate with anti-mouse CD3, clone 145-2C11 (3 g/ml).
Incubate at 37 C for 2 hours.
(Alternatively, incubate at 4 C overnight.)
Aseptically decant antibody solution from the plate.
Wash plate with sterile PBS (wash 1/3).
Wash plate with sterile PBS (wash 2/3).
Wash plate with sterile PBS (wash 3/3).
Discard liquid.
