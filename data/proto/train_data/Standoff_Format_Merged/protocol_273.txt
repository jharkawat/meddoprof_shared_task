OmniPrep For High Quality Genomic DNA Extraction From Blood Stained & Body Fluid Stained Material
To 10-30mm2 section of stained material in a 2ml microfuge tube, add 600 l Lysis Buffer and 10 l Proteinase K.
Invert to mix.
Incubate the sample at 65 C for 4 hours with periodic inversions.
Allow to cool to room temperature, remove the stained material and remove excess buffer from the material with a pipette and return to the tube.
Add 200 l chloroform and mix by inverting the tube several times.
Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 14,000xg and carefully remove the upper phase to a clean microcentrifuge tube.
Add 50 l DNA Stripping Solution to the sample and invert several times to mix.
Incubate the sample for 5-10 minutes at 60 C.
Add 100 l Precipitation Solution and mix by inverting the tube several times.
Centrifuge the sample at 14,000xg for 5 minutes.
Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube and precipitate the genomic DNA with 500 l isopropanol.
Invert the tubes 10 times to precipitate the DNA.
OPTIONAL : For increased DNA recovery, add 2 l Mussel Glycogen as a DNA carrier.
Centrifuge at 14,000xg for 5 minutes to pellet genomic DNA.
Remove the supernatant.
Add 700 l 70 % ethanol to the tube and invert several times to wash the DNA pellet.
Centrifuge for 1 minute at 14,000xg.
Decant or pipette off the ethanol wash.
Invert the tube on a clean absorbent surface for several minutes to allow any excess ethanol to drain away.
Add 50 l TE Buffer to the pellet.
Incubate at room temperature for at least 15 minutes to rehydrate.
OPTIONAL : 1 l LongLife RNase for every 100 l TE Buffer can be added at this stage.
Store DNA at 4 C, for long term storage store at -20 C or -80 C.
