Grind and sterilise the spore heads : Get ready : At the flow hood .
Prepare eppendorf tubes , and 3 x 50mL falcon tubes : 1 ) for sterile water , 2 ) for Milton solution ( 1 Milton tablet in 25ml sterile water ) , and 3 ) for the washed spores heads .
Use two sporangia per transformation .
Check number of sporangia in the spore head ( this is variable , ex there may be only 1 sporangia in one spore head , and 5 sporangia in another spore head ) .
Add the spores heads to an eppendorf tube .
Depending on final number of spore heads needed , you may need to divide them into several eppendorfs tubes .
Add 0.5ml Milton solution to each eppendorf tube .
Use a plastic pestle to crush the sporangia and vortex them until completely re-suspended .
Filter crushed spore heads : Place the 70 m cell strainer on a 50 ml falcon tube .
Pour onto the filter the solution with ground sporangia from all eppendorfs , pour the 0.5 ml from each eppendorf .
The solution with spores will flush through the cell strainer .

Plate spores : Plate the 150 l of re-suspended spores on a 1/2 GB plate ( no antibiotics ) .
Use an L-shaped spreader .
If 0.5 ml aliquots made ( equivalent to 2 sporangia ) , use one plate per transformation .
If 1 ml aliquots made ( equivalent to 4 sporangia ) , use half a plate per transformation .
Grow upside down ( rhizoids will grow away from the media ) for 5-6 days at 21 C CL 150 E Sporelings ( germinated spores ) have red fluoresence from chlorophyll autofluorescence after ~ 3 days .
Agro transformation : Mix DNA and Agro : For each agro transformation , add 20-50ng of plasmid to 50 L of thawed electrocompetent Agrobacterium cells ( kept on ice ) .
Electroporate in a chilled 2 mm cuvette with a 2.5 kV pulse .
Recover Agro : Immediately add 1mL of SOC ( or LB ) and incubate 1-2h at 28 C 150 rpm .
Plate Agro : Streak 20-50 L on LB plates + antibiotics ( Kan 50 , Tet 5 , for GV2260 with a pGreen plasmid ) .
Each Agro transformation in a different plate .
Grow for 3 days at 28 C or 30 C , incubator .
Optional Agro colony PCR : all agrobacterium colonies on LB + antibiotics plates should be positive , however if there are some issues with the transformations it may be useful to do a quick screen to check if there are any false positives on the plate .
In that case , do a colony PCR of Agro colonies .
Grow Agro culture : ( ~ 15 '' set up sometime in the afternoon ) .
For each Agro transformation pick a single colony from plate , inoculate 5 ml LB media + antibiotics ( Kan 50 , Tet 5 for GV2260 with a pGreen plasmid ) in a 15 ml falcon tube ( unskirted tube ) .
Incubate at 28 C - 150 rpm ( wrap the tubes in foil ) and let grow for 1.5 days .
Agro induction with Acetosyringone : ( ~20 '' plus 6 h induction set up in the morning ) : Centrifuge the agrobacterium culture ( s ) 10 '' at 3000g .
For each agrobacterium culture , discard the supernatant and re-suspend in 3 ml of 1/2 GB media sup containing 100 M Acetosyringone .
Add acetosyringone to a final concentration of 100 M ( for 3ml media add 3 l 100 mM stock solution ) .
Shake for 6 h at 28 C at 150 rpm in the dark ( wrap the tubes in foil ) .
Agro co-Cultivation with sporelings .
Scrape the 6 days old sporelings from the plate using an L shaped spreader , gather the sporelings and move them into a 100-250 ml autoclaved flask .
Use one plate per flask ( transformation ) if you plated 2 sporangia per plate , or half a plate if you plated 4 sporangia per plate .
Add to each flask 25 ml of 1/2 GB media sup and 25 ul of 100mM Acetosyringone , for a final concentration of 100 M .
To each flask , add 1ml of the appropiate Agrobacterium culture ( induced 6 h prior ) .
Co-cultivate for 2 days ( at least 36 h or 1.5 days ) on a shaker in the tissue culture room ( 21 C , CL 150-200 uE ) Sporelings Collection .
Add cefotaxime 100mg/ml stock solution to sterile water for a final concentration of 100ug/ml , 150-200 ml are needed per flask of co-cultivation .
For each co-cultivation flask ( transformation ) , collect the sporelings by pouring the flask contents in a 70 m cell strainer placed on a 1L bottle .
Rinse the sporeling by pouring over them 150-200ml of water + cefo 100 Sporelings plating .
For each co-cultivation flask ( transformation ) , with the help of a tip and a few ml of water + cefo remove the sporelings from the cell strainer and spread them on at least 3 plates ( 1/2 GB plates with antibiotics ) , make sure they are well spread , the better the spread the better the transgenic plants will grow .
Screening for transformants : Positive transformants grow while non-trasnformed sporelings die .
Positive transformants become evident from about 1 week after plating .
Positive transformants with a fluorescent marker in the T-DNA can start to be screened under the microscope after about 5 days .
Once positive transformants have grown , from about a week and a half onwards , they should be transferred to new 1/2 GB plates with antibiotics , so they can grow faster and make gemmae

General protocol for the concentration of virioplankton from a large volume ( > 20 L ) water sample
Prefilter ambient water sample with a 25- m wound polypropylene sediment filter before any concentration using a peristaltic or diaphragm pump .
Rinse the concentration container three times with prefiltered water before filling with prefiltered sample water .
Once the concentration container is full of 25 m prefiltered ambient water , arrange the tubing for tangential flow filtration ( TFF ) .
Attach the 0.22- m tangential flow filtration ( TFF ) filter feed and retentate tubing to the TFF filter housing inlet and outlet ports , respectively .
Attach the permeate tubing to the permeate port of the TFF filter housing and direct into a separate container to catch virus-containing water .
Run the feed tubing through a large peristaltic pump head .
If the peristaltic pump head has an occlusion setting , set it to maximal occlusion to help prime the 0.22- m TFF filter and remove all air .
Turn the peristatic pump on and increase the peristaltic pump speed to 20 % to prime the tubing and remove excess air .
Once the tubing and filter are completely filled with water , adjust the occlusion knob to a looser setting to prevent excessive tubing wear .
Slowly increase the pump speed to 45 % .
Once the system is running smoothly , partially open the permeate valve on the 0.22- m TFF filter to the second tick mark ( ~20 open ) .
Collect the < 0.22 m permeate into an appropriately sized carboy .
When the permeate carboy is more than half full with < 0.22 m permeate , prepare the 30-kD TFF filter for viral concentration .
Slow the large peristaltic pump speed to 10 % .
Attach the feed and retentate tubing to the appropriate ports on the 30-kD TFF .
Direct the permeate tubing from the 30-kD TFF filter into a clean carboy to collect ultrafiltrate ( UF ; virus-free water ) .
Carefully work the feed tubing into the second pump head of the large peristaltic pump .
Increase the large peristaltic pump speed to 20 % .
Again , tighten the occlusion knob on the pump head to prime the 30-kD TFF filter and remove all air .
Once the filter and lines are fully primed loosen the pump head occlusion knob .
Slowly increase the pump speed to 45 % .
Slowly close the backpressure knob on the 30-kD TFF filter until permeate begins to flow .
Monitor the level of < 0.22 m water in the < 0.22 m permeate carboy .
The level should be maintained at half full until the pre filtered ambient water is nearly gone .
Collect 1 L of ultra filtrate ( 30 kD TFF permeate ) in a 2-L bottle for rinsing of the 30-kD TFF filter .
When ~5 L of 25 m filtered ambient water remains in the large carboy , release the pump head and remove the 0.22- m TFF filter feed tubing from the large peristaltic pump .
Continue to run the 30-kD TFF filter until ~1 L of < 0.22 m water remains in the carboy .
When 1L or less of < 0.22 m water remains , stop the large peristaltic pump and drain the 30-kD TFF filter into the < 0.22 m water carboy .
Slowly prime the 30-kD TFF filter from the 1 L of collected UF from step 22 and then recirculate ( feed , retentate and permeate lines of the 30-kD filter in the 1L of UF ) the UF at 30 % pump speed for 5 min .
Stop the pump , release the pump head , and drain all tubing into the 2-L UF bottle .
Pool the recirculated UF with the ~1 L of retentate from the primary viral concentration through the 30-kD TFF filter .
The volume of the ~2 L viral concentrate can be further reduced by using a small-scale TFF ultrafilter .
To avoid excessive degradation of viruses , it is advisable to store the first stage VC at 4 C and perform a second stage small-scale concentration a soon as possible ( i.e. , within no more than 1 d ) .
Insure that the permeate port is closed , then begin priming the system as follows .

Monterey Wharf II Weekly Phytoplankton Monitoring Sample Collection and Processing .
Notes A vertical net tow is collected using a 25 m mesh plankton net with a 200mL cod-end piece at a depth of 5 m .
Total phytoplankton biomass is estimated from in vivo chlorphyll fluorescence on dark adapted net and whole water samples using a calibrated Aquaflor fluorometer ( Turner Designs ) .
Vertical whole water samples are collected using a VanDorn at discreet 1m intervals and integrated over 5m .
Species relative abundance is assessed microscopically from 1 % glutaraldehyde preserved samples quantified on a nanoplankton counting chamber ( Phycotech ) .
The following samples are processed and archived for later analysis :
Nutrients : Whole water is passed through a 0.2 m syringe filter and stored at -20 C .
Nucleic Acids : 50 mLs of the net tow sample are filtered through 1.2 m Isopore membrane filter ( Millipore ) and extracted into Trizol ( Invitrogen ) before being archived at -80 C .
Protein and Amino Acids : 50mLs of the net tow are filtered through 2 m Isopore membrane filter ( Millipore ) and extracted into 80 % Methanol before being archived at -80 C .

This softlayer is allowed to cool slightly ( to ca . 80 C ) .
Approximately 3 mL of softlayer are added to ca . 0.2 mL of exponentially growing host cells , generally Sulfolobus solfataricus , and spread on a plate by swirling .
After the Gelrite solidifies , 1 2 L of culture or supernatant to be screened is spotted on the plate .
For a positive control , 1 L of a 0.01 % ( v/v ) Triton X-100 solution is spotted .
Plates are incubated as above for 2 3 d and plates examined for clearing around spots ( Fig . 1D in guidelines ) .
Western Blot
Place gels in the Bio-Rad gel running apparatus and make sure they are locked into place , then pour 1x Protein Running Buffer inbetween the two gels until it 's about 25 % full to ensure there are no leaks .
After no leaks have been found , fill the middle up the rest of the way up so it covers the top of the wells and pour 1x Protein Running Buffer outside of the gels so it covers the bottom of the glass .
Remove the combs from each gel and wash lanes a few times with 1x Protein Running Buffer , then load your samples and ladder .
In any unused wells , fill them up with a similar volume that you loaded your samples with of 1x Protein Running Buffer .
Run 10 % gels at 150 volts until the ladder reaches the bottom of the glass .
Cut nitrocellulose membrane and pieces of filter paper to the same size as the gel , and cut one corner so you are able to orient yourself to which side is the front or back , then soak in 100 % methanol , followed by quickly submerging in 1x Transfer Buffer for at least 15 minutes .
Pour out 1x Protein Running Buffer ( can reuse 1 time ) into a bottle and then remove the gels from the gel apparatus .
Separate the glass pieces , remove the gel , cut off and discard the stacking portion , and submerge the separating portion in 1x Transfer Buffer for at least 15 minutes .
Pour 1x Transfer Buffer into Bio-Rad transfer apparatus and soak both sponges and filter paper in the buffer .
Open up plastic sandwich , and starting with the clear side :
Place a wet sponge down .
Place a wet piece of filter paper .
Place the nitrocellulose membrane onto the filter paper ( down in the middle first then let each side down so you have no air bubbles ) .
Place the gel on the same way .
Place the other piece of filter paper down the same way .
Use a 15 mL centrifuge tube and roll from one side of the sandwich to the other to ensure there are no air bubbles .
Place the other sponge on top , then fold the black side up and lock the clear and black sides together so there is a complete sandwich , and load it into the center of the transfer apparatus , so that the black side of the sandwich matches the black side of the sandwich holder , and the clear side is closer to the red side of the sandwich holder .
Load the ice block into the apparatus then fill the Bio-Rad container to the top with chilled 1x Transfer Buffer .
Add the lid to the container , plug it into the amplifier , and perform the transfer at room temperature at 50 volts for two hours .
Remove membrane from sandwich , rinse with water , and submerge in TBST + 5 % Milk with shaking for two hours to initiate blocking .
Dump the TBST + Milk , then add 10 mL of fresh TBST + 5 % Milk and 1 uL Primary Antibody ( all mixed together before submerging the membrane in it ) and let it rock at 4 C from two hours to overnight .
Pour off TBST and 5 % Milk with the Antibody and do five 10 minute washes with TBST and shaking at room temperature .
Dump the TBST , then add 10 mL of fresh TBST + 5 % Milk and 1 uL Secondary Antibody ( all mixed together before submerging the membrane in it ) and let it incubate while shaking at room temperature for 1 hour .
Pour off TBST and 5 % Milk with the Antibody and do five 10 minute washes with TBST and shaking at room temperature .
Add just enough BCIP/NBT to cover the membrane and let it shake at room temperature until bands develop .

Protocol for SYBR Counts of Cyanophages and Bacteria
Make dilutions of the sample ( s ) .
Record volume of samples used .
Custom has been to use 20 l of phage stocks or 200 l of cells diluted to 2 ml with autoclaved seawater .
If the final slides appear too sparse or dense then the volume of sample used can be adjusted accordingly .
Remove the 10 % SYBR and phenylenediamine from the freezer .
Keep the stocks away from light ( such as in a drawer ) while they are thawing .
Connect the glass flask to the vacuum pump .
Attach the filter holder so that the grout is flat and level with the table .
Place a 0.8 m filter on top of the grout .
Make sure it is completely flat and centered , with no air bubbles underneath ( pre-wetting the grout helps ) .
This filter can be used many times so long as it stays intact and flat .
Place the 0.02 m filter on top of the 0.8 m filter .
Again , make sure it is flat and centered with no air bubbles underneath .
Turning on the vacuum for a brief while can help achieve this .
Clamp the funnel on top of the filters .
Add the sample and turn on the pump ( pressure should be ~20 kPa or 7 mmHg ) .
After the last liquid passes through the funnel and clamp should be removed with the vacuum still on .
Turn off the vacuum ; remove 0.02 m filter .
Keep track of which side of the filter is the top .
Blot out any seawater on the bottom or the top plastic rim with a kimwipe .
It is very important to make sure the filters are completely dry before continuing .
It is a good idea to rub the back of the filter with a kimwipe and then stick it in a dessicator ( we used a makeshift box with some drying rocks ) for a few minutes .
Prepare a 100 L drop of SYBR , made fresh from 2.5 L 10 % stock + 97.5 L 0.02 m filtered deionized water , on the bottom of a plastic Petri dish .
Lay the 0.02 Anodisc filters sample side up on the drops of the SYBR staining solution for 15 minutes in a dark drawer or box .
While waiting it may be a good time to prepare the antifade solution .
Dry completely as in steps 7-8 .
Do not touch the top of the filter .
Place the filter sample-side up on a glass slide .
Place 30 L of antifade on a cover slip ; then invert slip and place on top of the filter .
Appy pressure to ensure that the antifade fills the space underneath the square .
View with blue excitation .
Examine at least ten fields in the microscope ( We usually examine 20 ) .
Count at least 200 viruses or bacteria total for ten fields ( 400 for 20 fields ) .
Field size may be full ( counting all particles in all 100 small squares ) or smaller ( e.g . 5 small squares ) , depending on the virus/bacteria concentration .
Find the average number of particles per quadrant ( 25 small squares ) .
Multiply this by a scaling factor of 1.26 x 105 to get the total number of particles on the filter .
Divide this by the volume used ( e.g . 20 L ) to get the titer in particles per ml .

Building an HPC blast pipeline
Login to the hpc ( at the University of Arizona ) with your user name Create a directory for the pipeline Go to the hpc-blast directory and create sub directories to hold std-err , std-out , data , blastdb , blast-results and scripts .
Go to the blastdb directory and create the blast database .
Copy the input files over from iPlant .
We will be using the day/night transcriptomes we discussed last week .
You will use two of the Perl scripts from the homework in the hpc pipeline .
Put these into the scripts directory .
config.sh : Now we need to create the config.sh script .
This script will contain all of the environmental variables that the user will be able to modify for running blast .
The idea of this script is to give the user one place to make any changes they need to run their particular blast job .
The user should not have to go in and change any of the scripts in the 'scripts ' directory .
Instead , we will capture all of these variable here .
* note the the config.sh script is in the hpc-blast directory ( in the first part of the pipeline ) , where it is easy for the user to modify it .
blast-pipeline.sh : Now we will create the `` driver script '' , the script that is used to run each part of the pipeline .
run-fasta-splitter.sh .
Create a shell script that runs the fasta splitter perl code .
run-blast.sh : Create a shell script that runs blast on a compute node .
run-parse-blast.sh : Create a shell script to parse the blast output that runs on a compute node on the cluster .
04-blast-search.pl : modify the blast search script.Update the e-value to be less stringent.Modify the Perl script 04-blast-search.pl to include additional information about the hit .
Make all of the scripts executable and then run the pipeline.If you do n't get any errors , the pipeline will take < 1 day to run .
Check to see if the pipeline is running Once the pipeline is finished running ( and you do n't see the jobs listed under qstat ) , check for std-errors and std-out.Note you can check while the pipeline is running too .
Now you try.See if you can update the pipeline to add one final step that puts all of the parsed blast output into a single file for each of the original fasta files.Note that you can comment out the parts of the blast-pipeline.sh that you have already run in the steps above , to test your code .
Otherwise , these will run again.Also , before you run this final step , make sure the blast parsing is complete.Can this run on the head node , or should we run this on a compute node ? The complete pipeline can be found in github here .
Commit your code to your own github abe487 repository using the directory : hpc-blast
Basic Illumina Sequence Quality Control
Assess raw FASTQ sequences using the program FastQCGoal .
Remove low quality sequences to increase average quality score of reads above 28 For current sequencing centers , the 5 ' end of has had Illumina adapters and primers removed .
But there can be inclusion of the 3 ' end Illumina adapter in DNA fragments with length less than the number of the cycles for the sequencer .
Remove Illumina adaptor sequences from 3 ' end of sequences - be sure to preserve reads of 0 length .
Repeat step for all raw read files .
Assess Cutadapt results with FastQC .
Remove low quality base pairs from sequences , generally from the 3 ' end , using a sliding window of 10 bp that will trim all trailing bases if the average quality score drops below 28 .
Important : To maintain the order of paired-end Illumina sequences both reads must be input simultaneously with the same number of sequences submitted from each read pair , regardless of the length of the sequence .
Assess file quality scores using FastQC .
Utilize Trimmomatic for any other issues - such as poor quality in the first bp , etc .

One-step Phage Infection of Cyanobacteria ( large-scale )
Before T0 , use flow cytometry to measure cell concentrations of cyanobacterial cultures from Step 2 .
Use SYBR staining ( e.g . SYBR counts of viruses ) to determine concentration of your concentrated viral lysate from Step 1 .
Calculate volumes of cells , phage and media to add to each experimental bottle/tube .
We have an Excel template to do this calculation , based on the desired MOI , cell concentration , and final experimental culture volume .
For gene expression experiments , we use an MOI of 3 , final cell density of 5e7/ml , and volume of 200ml for each replicate -- this scale allows us to sample for RNA , protein , and phage & cell concentration , over a 12-14 hour time course .
Working quickly , and with sterile technique , initialize experiment by mixing volumes ( calculated in Step 3 ) of media , cells , and phage .
First add appropriate volume of sterile medium to your experimental culture vessel ( e.g . sterile 250ml polycarbonate bottles for 200ml cultures ) .
Then add cells ( prepared in Step 2 ) .
Then , to uninfected control bottles , add lysate that has been filtered to remove phage particles ( e.g . the filtrate that goes through an Amicon centrifugal device ) .
[ This is important to control for small molecules that may be added with the phage particles in infected treatments ; however keep in mind that other large molecules will get retained , along with phage particles , in the Amicon reservoir . ]
Finally , just before T0 , add phage to their respective bottles .
This begins the one-step infection .
Mix bottles by gentle vortexing .
Sample immediately for time 0 .
Suggested sampling : FCM for cell counts , Fluorescence , extracellular phage , RNA-protein .
Place bottles in incubator until next time point .
Repeat sampling in Step 5 at each time point ( e.g . every 1-2 hours ) until lysis is complete .
Prepare cells for infection : Grow up sufficiently large volumes of cells to be infected .
Plan carefully so that cells are in mid-log phase on the day of the experiment .
If you are growing volumes of 1L or more , bubble your culture with an aquarium pump ( ambient air ) connected to a diffuser stone , to prevent CO2 limitation .
Prepare phage stockGrow : On day minus-8 , add phage stock to 4L of mid-log cells to start the infection ( a low MOI is sufficient , e.g . 0.01-0.05 ) , and monitor for about a week until the culture clears .
Harvest : When the culture has cleared ( i.e . most cells have lysed ) , centrifuge the cleared culture ( max speed , 10 min ) to remove large cell debris and unlysed cells .
Pour supernatant ( containing phage ) into disposable sterile vacuum filtration units containing a 0.2 m PES filter ; discard the pellet containing cell debris .
Connect to vacuum source and filter the lysate ; save filtrate containing your phage particles .
Concentrate : Concentrate this clarified phage lysate using VivaFlow Concentration of Phage Lysate .
Further concentrate the phage stock , and exchange buffers/media if necessary ( e.g . to remove P , N , or other nutrients in the initial lysate ) using Amicon Concentration of Viruses .

Detecting Fungal Infections in Almonds
Manually select almond kernel samples that are pasteurized and shelled .
As mentioned in the 'Before Start Instructions ' , the almond kernels should be collected from multiple harvest cycles .
These particular samples were obtained from the 2012 and 2013 almond seasons .
The samples should be shelled and should not have any type of physical damage or any marks .
Record weight and size of almond kernels .
Separate the samples into two groups .
Out of the 550 almond kernels collected 460 of those will be infected with two types of fungi that commonly affect almond crops .
230 will be infected with A. flavus and another 230 will be infected with A. parasiticus .
The remaining 90 kernels will remain uninfected and will serve as a control group .
Obtain A. flavus and A. parasiticus isolates to infect almonds .
These two types of fungi were chosen due to their well known colonization on the surface of almond kernels .
Prior to inoculation , take the fungi isolates and grow them in culture .
Use 5 % reconstituted tomato juice agar , in this case it will be V8 juice agar , and grow each isolate for 6 days at a temperature of 31 C in a dark environment .
Once fungal isolates have been grown , conidia is collected using a sterilized cotton swab and is deposited in sterile deionized water .
A haemocytometer will be used to quantify the water solution with conidia and it will then be diluted to a concentration of 105 spores per ml-1 .
Create incision on the bottom right of almond kernels using a B-D 16G1 PrecisionGlide Needle .
This incision serves as the point of infection where the conidia in water would be placed .
After making the incision on the surface of the almond , the kernels will be sterilized by submerging them in 10 % bleach solution for a period of 7 minutes .
The kernels will then be rinsed three times with sterile deionized water and will be submerged a second time into a Dichloran solution for 2 seconds .
Remove moisture from surface of almonds by blotting them and move them to a biological safety cabinet for a period of 10 to 15 minutes .
Inoculate each almond with 5 l of the fungi solution.As mentioned earlier , almonds will be in two separate groups : infected and control .
The infected almonds will be inoculated with either A. flavus or A. parasiticus .
Once the almonds have been inoculated , add deionized water to the container where they are located and incubate them for a period of 7 days at a temperature of 31 in a dark place .
Once the incubation period is over , wash almonds with deionized water to remove any traces of fungi spores from the surface .
Place almond kernels in a fume hood for a period of 12 hours .
Once the 12 hours are up keep kernels at a constant temperature of 2.6 C .
Take almond and put it under the spectrophotometer , then place black optic mask in the space between these two .
Scan the surface of the almond kernel using the spectrophotometer , for each individual almond kernel take 32 scans of the face across a wavelength range of 400 nm to 2500 nm , in 2-nm increments .
Use statistical analysis software to analyze the data gathered from all three groupings of almonds .

Isotopic labeling of freshwater mixotrophic algae using isotopic labeled inorganic nitrogen and carbon
Prepare modified DY-V media with labeled substrates .
Media used for Ochromonas growth was a modified version of DY-V media .
Modifications were : No MES was used , as it can be used as a source of carbon ( bicarbonate and heat-killed bacteria are the only sources of carbon used in this media ) .
No Na2SiO3 was used ( Ochromonas does not need silica ) .
No NaNO3 ( ammonium and heat-killed bacteria were the only sources of nitrogen used in this media ) .
Sodium bicarbonate added at a final concentration of 95 M .
Bicarbonate addition is done before algal inoculum by 0.2 m filtration of a stock solution ( do not autoclave ) .
In order to ensure isotopic labeling of the mixotrophic algae , 50 % of the ammonium chloride added to the media is ammonium-15N chloride ( 98 % atom 15N ) and all bicarbonate added to the media is 13C-bicarbonate .
NOTE : depending on the degree of labeling that wants to be achieved , the % of labeled ammonium and bicarbonate can be modified .
Add heat-killed bacteria ( HKB ) to the media ( HKB were obtained following this protocol ) .
Add an inoculum of the mixotrophic algae ( volume of inoculum should be low as to avoid dilution of the isotopic label and carry over of nutrients ) .
NOTE : as an example , values commonly used were ~5x103 Ochromonas mL-1 and ~5x107 HKB mL-1 as starting concentrations for the cultures .
Mixotrophic growth of the algae Let the algae grow so it incorporates the isotopic signature in its biomass .
Track the algae growth through microscopy ( live samples and/or fixed samples ) and the decline of heat-killed bacteria ( fixed samples and staining with DAPI to assess HKB concentrations through epifluorescence microscopy .
Sampling for assessment of algal isotopic signature Ochromonas was allowed to grow for 2-3 generations before sampling for isotopic signature .
Two kind of samples can be collected : Bulk measurements : filter 30-50 mL of the cultures onto pre-combusted glass fiber filters and dry at 60 C over night to stop all biological activity .
Afterwards , filters can be stored in glass vials at room temperature .
Further processing of the sample included an acidification step with HCl to remove inorganic carbon and the C- and N- isotopic composition of the sample was determined by an isotope rato mas spectrometer ( IRMS ) .
Cell-specific measurements : collect 2 mL of sample and fix with 2X EM-grade glutaraldehyde .
Sample can be stored in the fridge at 4 C .
Further processing of the sample involves the deposition of cells onto sylicon wafers , wash with MQ-water and drye ; map cells on the waffer using microscopy and analysis of single cells using a Cameca NanoSIMS 50 instrument ( NOTE : actual manipulation of the machine will be done by an expert user ) .

Aliquot 4mL of soft agar into sterile tubes and keep just above solidification temperature until use .
200 300 L bacterial culture is added to the 4 mL tubes with melted soft agar .
The bacteria-soft agar mixture is then vortexed and immediately poured onto an agar plate with an agar that supports growth of the host bacterium .
Distribute bacteria-soft agar mixture evenly on the plate , which is placed on a flat surface .
When the soft agar containing the target bacteria has solidified , triplicate aliquots of 5 10 L of each of the environmental water samples from which phages should be isolated are spotted on top of the soft agar .
As a negative control 5 10 L phage buffer ( e.g. , SM buffer : 450 mM NaCl , 50 mM MgSO4 , 50 mM Tris , 0.01 % Gelatin , pH = 8 ) or 0.02 m filtered sample water is spotted in triplicate on the soft agar .
The plates are incubated for 1 3 d depending on the growth rate of the bacteria , and the presence of lytic phages in the sample is detected as a clearing zone ( plaque ) in the spotted area of the lawn of bacteria that develops over time on the plate .
If clearing zones appear in the spotted area , this indicates the presence of lytic phages , which can be isolated and purified Once detected as clearings in the spotting zone , phages are further isolated and purified from the plates .

Generating viral metagenomes from the coral holobiont
At Trunk Reef , approximately 45 g of coral tissue was sampled from three healthy , freshly collected coral colonies of Pocillopora damicornis .
Approximately 20 g of Acropora tenuis tissue was sampled from three healthy , freshly collected coral colonies collected in Pioneer Bay .
Fragments were washed in autoclaved , 0.02 m filtered virus-free seawater .
Subsequently , tissue was blasted from the coral skeleton , using an air-gun , into 15 mL 0.02 m filtered ( Anotop , Whatman ) SM buffer ( 100 mM NaCl , 8 mM MgSO4 , 50 mM Tris pH 7.5 ) in a zip-lock bag .
Briefly , 5 mL of chloroform per 40 mL of coral blastate was added and samples were agitated gently for 1 h at room temperature .
Coral blastates were homogenized at 5000 rpm for 1 min ( Heidolph SilentCrusher ) .
Samples were immediately centrifuged at 1000 g for 15 min .
The supernatant was transferred to sterile glass corex tubes and spun at 12,000 g for 15 min to pellet the majority of microbial cells ( Beckman Coulter JA 25.50 rotor ) .
A cesium chloride ( CsCl ) density gradient was then formed by layering 1 mL of 1.7 , 1.5 , and 1.35 g mL 1 CsCl into 13.2 mL UltraClear ultracentrifuge tubes ( Beckman Coulter ) with 9 mL sample layered on the top of the gradient .
Gradients were then centrifuged for 2 h at 60,000 g at 4 C in a swinging bucket rotor .
In the MECH method , the coral tissue blastate was homogenized at 10,000 rpm for 1 min .
The coral tissue blastate was then spun at 400 g for 5 min .
The supernatant was then aliquoted into 1.5 mL aliquots in 2 mL eppendorf tubes containing 0.3 mL acid-washed glass beads ( 425 600 m diameter ) ( Sigma-Aldrich ) .
The tubes were placed in a bead beater and cells were disrupted at 5000 rpm for 5 min .
Tubes were centrifuged at top speed in a bench-top Eppendorf centrifuge for 1 min .
The supernatant was collected for viral fractionation using step CsCl density gradients .
To confirm that the MECH method was not disrupting virus particles , two dsDNA viruses , OtV-2 ( Weynberg et al. , 2011 ) and EhV-86 ( Wilson et al. , 2005b ) , were subjected to the same mechanical disruption protocol .
Flow cytometry was used to enumerate viruses before and after disruption .
All samples were treated with DNase and RNase ( Ambion ) prior to nucleic acid extraction .
DNA was extracted and RNase treated using a MasterPure kit ( Epicentre , Illumina ) following manufacturer 's instructions .
RNA was extracted using a Qiagen QIAamp viral RNA kit ( Qiagen ) following manufacturer 's instructions , including the final DNase step ( Ambion ) .
Two different amplification methods were used .
In order to reduce some of the inherent biases in multi-displacement amplification ( MDA ) , such as a preference for ssDNA viral genomes , DNA extractions were converted to dsDNA prior to amplification .
Triplicate 10 L aliquots of the DNA extractions , containing ds and ssDNA viral genomes , underwent a single round of Klenow reaction ( 3 5 exo- , 5U/ L ) by mixing 1.5 L of 10 reaction buffer ( New England Biolabs Buffer 2 ) , 1.5 L of dNTPs ( 2.5 mM stock ) , 1 L of random hexamer primers ( 50 ng/ L , Invitrogen ) .
The reaction was incubated at 94 C for 3 min .
The reaction was then placed on ice for 3 min to allow for primer annealing .
1 L of Klenow ( 3 5 exo- ) was added and incubated at 25 C for 10 min .
It was then incubated at 37 C for 60 min .
It was then incubated with a termination step of 75 C for 20 min .
After termination , reactions were pooled and cleaned using a Qiagen QIAamp DNA mini kit and eluted in 50 L of Buffer AE .
Replicate MDA reactions ( n = 3 for each sample ) were amplified using 2.5 L dsDNA template and the Qiagen RepliG kit using the standard protocol .
All reactions were run on a 0.8 % agarose gel in 1 TAE at 100 V for 30 min to confirm amplification , pooled and cleaned with QIAampl DNA minikit and eluted in 200 L of Buffer AE .
Negative controls were treated the same and also sent for sequencing to confirm that no viral contamination was present .
As with the RepliG protocol , Klenow Fragment ( 3 5 exo- ) was used to convert all DNA genomes to dsDNA using RP-SISPA primers with a 3 random hexamer sequence that is used for downstream PCR amplification .
To label the first strand with the RP-SISPA primer , 5 L of nucleic acid was added to 9 L reaction mix containing : The reaction was incubated at 94 C for 3 min .
The reaction was then placed on ice for 3 min to allow for primer annealing .
1 L of Klenow Fragment ( 3 5 exo- , 5U/ L , NEB # ) was added and incubated at 37 C for 60 min .
A second round of Klenow Fragment reaction ( 3 5 exo ) labeled the second strand with the SISPA primer , by adding an additional 1 L of primer and 1 L dNTP .
The reaction then underwent a 94 C for 3 min heating step .
The reaction was then put on ice for 3 min .
The reaction then underwent a final addition of 1 L of Klenow Fragment ( 3 5 exo- ) .
The reaction was incubated at 37 C for 60 min .
The reaction was then terminated at 75 C for 20 min .
Briefly , in preparation for cDNA synthesis , 10 L purified RNA viral template was mixed with 1 L of 2.5 mM dNTPs and 1.3 L of FR26RV-N ( GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGATATCNNNNNN , 10 M stock ) and FR40RV-T primer ( GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGATATC ( T ) 20 , 50 nM stock ) .
The reaction was heated to 65 C for 5 min .
The reaction was then cooled on ice for 3 min to allow the primers to anneal .
While still on ice , 1 L DTT ( Invitrogen ) was added to the reaction as an enzyme stabilization reagent with 1 L RNase OUT ( Invitrogen ) to protect the sample from RNAse activity .
The complementary DNA strand was synthesized with 200 U of Superscript III reverse transcriptase .
The reaction was incubated initially at 25 C for 10 min to allow annealing of the hexamer 3 end of primer FR26RV-N and the poly ( T ) 20 3 end of primer FR40RV-T to the template while cDNA synthesis commenced .
The temperature was then increased to 50 C for 60 min .
The first strand synthesis reaction was heated immediately to 94 C for 3 min and then rapidly cooled on ice .
A complementary second strand was subsequently synthesized at 37 C for 60 min with the addition of 1 L Klenow Fragment ( 3 5 exo- , 5U/ L ) .
The Klenow reaction was terminated with a final incubation at 75 C for 20 min .
PCR amplification of the SISPA primer labeled template ( DNA and RNA ) was done in triplicate 25 L reactions containing : The reaction was incubated at 95 C for 10 min .
The reaction then underwent 30 cycles of denaturation at : The PCR reactions were loaded on to a 0.8 % agarose gel in 1 TAE at 100 V for 30 min .
If amplification resulted in visible PCR products ( typically a smear ; products should be longer than 250 bp ) , a reconditioning PCR was performed on pooled reactions as follows .
One reconditioning PCR contained 10 L of pooled SISPA reaction template , 10 L 10 buffer , 16 L dNTP ( 2.5 mM stock ) , 8 L FR20RV primer ( 10 M stock ) and 0.75 L TaKaRa LA HS Taq .
The reaction was incubated at 95 C for 10 min .
The reaction then underwent 5 cycles of denaturation at : Reactions were cleaned and QC was assessed .
After amplification , samples were cleaned with a QIAamp DNA Mini kit ( RepliG amplification ) or a MinElute PCR purification kit ( RP-SISPA ) .
Samples were checked for quantification using a Quant-iT PicoGreen kit on a NanoDrop 3300 fluorospecrometer , for quality ( 260:280 ratios ) on a NanoDrop 2000 , and were run on a 0.8 % agarose gel in 1 TAE at 100 V for 30 min to confirm a size range appropriate for sequencing ( ~250 500 bp ) was present without contamination of smaller fragments .
All metagenomes were sequenced using Nextera XT MiSeq 250 bp paired-end sequencing ( Illumina ) at the Ramaciotti Centre , University of New South Wales , Sydney , Australia .
Raw sequence reads were processed in CLC Genomics Workbench 5.5 .
Sequences were imported as Illumina paired-end reads , adaptor sequences were trimmed , and reads were checked for quality using a PHRED score of 20 and a minimum length of 100 bp .
Paired reads were merged and a final data set containing merged reads and ORFans was checked again for QC with a minimum length of 200 bp .
To carry out the taxonomic assignment , these non-assembled read data sets were uploaded to the Metavir web server , which is dedicated to the analysis of viral metagenomes ( http : //metavir-meb.univ-bpclermont.fr ) ( Roux et al. , 2011 ) .
All virus sequences were further classified into families using the taxonomic information from the top BLAST hit .
Tetranucleotide clustering and rarefaction curves were generated using tools available through Metavir .
The five datasets generated from the P. damicornis samples were submitted to Genbank Sequence Read Archive ( SRA ) and are available under the accession numbers SRR1207981 , SRR1207983 , SRR1207980 , SRR1207984 , and SRR1246941 ( Table 1 in guidelines ) .
The two datasets generated from the A. tenuis samples have also been deposited in the SRA under the accession numbers SRR1207979 and SRR1210582 .

Precision Count Beads Protocol and Applications
Perform sample preparation and staining as usual .
Some examples of sample that may be used are : a . Cell lines , b . Whole blood , c. PBMC , d. Cells from migration assays .
Note : Sample handling such as centrifugation , decanting , or transferring between different tubes can significantly affect cell counts and should be kept to a minimum .
Vigorously vortex the Precision Count Beads bottle for 30-40 seconds to ensure complete mixing and break up of aggregates that may occur during storage .
Add 50 l of Precision Count Beads per sample .
Accurate pipetting is crucial at this stage .
We recommend using reverse pipetting to ensure pipetting of an accurate amount of beads .
Set up the FSC and SSC channels for the cells of interest as recommended or previously defined , ensuring that the FSC threshold is not too high .
Precision Count Beads have a high SSC and low FSC profile .
Thus , SSC should be adjusted in such a way that the cells are optimally visible .
This can be done by acquiring a sample of Precision Count Beads alone and compare to the cells profile .
Adjust compensation for the samples if needed Precision Count Beads are highly fluorescent in all channels .
Make sure to adjust the voltage to optimally detect the Precision Count Beads in at least one fluorescent channel .
Acquire samples on a flow cytometer , gently vortexing every sample prior to acquisition to ensure adequate suspension of the cell and bead populations .
Data analysis should be performed as usual to identify the cell population ( s ) of interest .
In an ungated plot of the same sample , Precision Count Beads can be visualized using one or two fluorescent parameters and a gate set around the bead population .
The bead count and cell count can be obtained using the statistics function from the software .
Absolute counts can then be calculated using formulas provided in the example below .

It is useful to let the worms crawl on a no bacteria plate before picking to avoid accidental transfer of siblings .
If 2 F1s were pooled per plate , clone 16 F2s .
If 8 F1s were pooled per plate , chunk the starved plate if necessary and clone 24 to 32 F2/F3s .
Lyse and PCR F2/3s using the same methods as for the F1s .
EXCEPT : When looking for homozygous GFP worms , use primers that flank the GFP fusion .
Use the PCR product for sequencing : Clean 25ul of the PCR reaction using Qiagen Minelute kit , elute with 10ul of H2O .
Use 7ul for this elution as a template and use a primer inside the PCR product for sequencing .
Once a homozygous F2/3 plate is identified , it is recommended to clone 4 worms again to new plates and to verify their genotype to ensure that the line is truly homozygous .
Freeze the worms .
We recommend freezing at least two independent lines ( derived from different P0s if possible or different F1s ) for each type of edit .

Isolation and isotopic labeling of bacteria
Prepare M9 media stocks .
The recipe for 1L of minimal growth medium ( M9 ) is as follows :
After cooling of the autoclaved mix , add the rest of the components by 0.2 m filter sterilization .
In order to prepare solid media for plating , add 1.5 % agar ( 15 gr agar per 1 L of media ) prior to autoclaving .
Allow cooling of the media prior to add the 0.2 m filter sterilization components .
Pour the media in Petri dishes and allow solidification of agar .
To prepare 1 L of the 5x M9 salts stock ( autoclaved ) .
For isotopic labeling , use D-glucose-1-13C ( 99 % atom 13C ) and ammonium-15N chloride ( 98 % atom 15N )
Vitamins and trace metals stock used were the same as for algal DY-V media .
Bacterial plating .
Use a small volume ( i.e . 0.1 mL ) of the sample you want to isolate your bacteria to inoculate M9 agar plates .
Ensure correct striking and dispersal of the inoculum to facilitate picking of individual colonies afterwards .
Bacterial growth Incubate bacteria at a temperature of choice .
Bacteria isolated from the algal cultures were chosen to grow at 30 C .
Inspect plates after 24h until big enough colonies are visible to pick .
Picking and transfer of colonies .
Using sterile picks , transfer a single colony of bacteria into M9 liquid media .
Recommended to do a first transfer into a small volume ( ~ 25 - 50 mL ) .
Prepare a battery of tubes beforehand with M9 liquid media and pick a variety of colonies .
Production of labeled bacterial biomass .
In order to produce a large ammount of biomass , transfer some of the bacteria from the M9 cultures tubes to a larger volume ( i.e . 1L ) .
Let bacteria grow until media is completely cloudy and a maximum yield is achieved of biomass ( can be 3-4 days until C and N is consummed ) .
NOTE : for isotopic labeling , M9 media used in this step will contain 15NH4Cl and 13C D-glucose .

Sea stars bacterial sampling
Collected sea stars by hand .
Rinse the location for sampling of the star with sterile seawater to remove any transient microbes .
This is important since the stars are in constant contact with environmental microbes and our sequencing technique is very sensitive ; therefore , rinsing reduces noise .
For healthy individuals the sampling site ( where the swabbing will occur ) should be approximately 15 by 10 cm .
Remove a clean sterile swab from its wrapping and the cotton tip should be applied to the previously rinsed sample location .
The swab should be pulled across the sample location with moderate pressure .
One swab consists of pulling the swab back and forth one ; this should be done 10 times .
The swab should be placed into a labeled sterile screw cap tube and then kept on ice until it can be frozen at -80 Swabs are then ready for DNA extraction .
Previously we have used a MoBio PowerSoil Kit .

Qiagen QIAquick PCR Purification Kit Protocol
Add 5 volumes of Buffer PB to 1 volume of the PCR sample and mix .
It is not necessary to remove mineral oil or kerosene .
If pH indicator I has beein added to Buffer PB , check that the color of the mixture is yellow .
If the color of the mixture is orange or violet , add 10 l of 3 M sodium acetate , pH 5.0 , and mix .
The color of the mixture will turn to yellow .
Place a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 ml collection tube .
To bind DNA , apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30 60 s. Discard flow-through .
Place the QIAquick column back into the same tube .
To wash , add 0.75 ml Buffer PE to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30 60 s .
Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back in the same tube .
Centrifuge the column for an additional 1 min .
IMPORTANT : Residual ethanol from Buffer PE will not be completely removed unless the flow-through is discarded before this additional centrifugation .
Place QIAquick column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube .
To elute DNA , add 50 l Buffer EB ( 10 mM Tris Cl , pH 8.5 ) or water ( pH 7.0 8.5 ) to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min .
Alternatively , for increased DNA concentration , add 30 l elution buffer to the center of the QIAquick membrane , let the column stand for 1 min , and then centrifuge .
IMPORTANT : Ensure that the elution buffer is dispensed directly onto the QIAquick membrane for complete elution of bound DNA .
The average eluate volume is 48 l from 50 l elution buffer volume , and 28 l from 30 l elution buffer .
Elution efficiency is dependent on pH .
The maximum elution efficiency is achieved between pH 7.0 and 8.5 .
When using water , make sure that the pH value is within this range , and store DNA at 20 C as DNA may degrade in the absence of a buffering agent .
The purified DNA can also be eluted in TE buffer ( 10 mM Tris Cl , 1 mM EDTA , pH 8.0 ) , but the EDTA may inhibit subsequent enzymatic reactions .
If the purified DNA is to be analyzed on a gel , add 1 volume of Loading Dye to 5 volumes of purified DNA .
Mix the solution by pipetting up and down before loading the gel .
Loading dye contains 3 marker dyes ( bromophenol blue , xylene cyanol , and orange G ) that facilitate estimation of DNA migration distance and optimization of agarose gel run time .
Refer to Table 2 ( page 15 ) to identify the dyes according to migration distance and agarose gel percentage and type .

Data Collection .
Turn on the Molecular Devices SpectraMax 340PC plate reader .
Log into the attached computer and open the SoftMax Pro 6 software .
Open or create a new Basic Endpoint protocol file ( .spr ) .
Rename the experiment appropriately and configure a plate with the following settings : Read Type : Endpoint Wavelength : 750 nm Plate Type : 96-well standard clear bottom Read Area : All Path check : Calibration on Shake : Once for 3 sec .
More settings : Column priority .
Add New plates as needed so there is one for each replicate plate in your assay ( settings will copy to these new plates within the same experiment ) .
If the SpectraMax doesn t automatically connect , click on the instrument icon in the top left corner and manually select it from the menu .
Select the plate to be read in the software , and place the corresponding plate on the plate reader drawer ( with Column 1 closest to the instrument ) .
Remove the plate lid and select Read to read the plate .
Read each plate individually , and copy the data ( must right-click to do this ) into an Excel spreadsheet .

Adjust to an optical density measured at 525 nm ( OD525 ) of 0.3 0.5 .
Approximately 25 mL water sample is filtered ( 0.2 m or 0.45 m syringe filters ) to minimize the risk of bacterial contamination of the enrichment cultures .
Transfer filtered samples to triplicate sterile 100 mL culture flasks .
Add 3 mL 10 growth medium ( i.e. , 10 times concentrated medium ) .
Start enrichment cultures by adding 1 mL of each of the target host strains of interest ( e.g. , 1 6 different strains for each incubation ) to the culture flask .
Incubate the cultures on a shaking table at a temperature and period that is appropriate for the host bacteria .
A control culture is established where the environmental sample is replaced by 25 mL artificial seawater ( or 0.02 m filtered water sample ) to verify bacterial growth in absence of phages .
Dimethylglyoxime reagent for cobalt analyses
Dissolve 0.2232 g of EDTA into 600 mL of Milli-Q for a final concentration of 10-3 mol L-1 EDTA .
Weigh out approximately 1.2 g of DMG ( dimethylglyoxime ) onto a weigh boat , and combine it into the EDTA solution .
Weigh what is left on the weigh boat ( DMG is very sticky so not all of it will pour into the EDTA solution ) and record the final weight that was placed into the EDTA solution .
Heat this solution in a microwave at 50 % power until the DMG is fully dissolved , stirring it carefully in between microwaving , and trying to prevent it from boiling .
This takes up to 30 minutes , so be patient and heat it slowly and carefully .
Put the solution on ice and let it recrystallize overnight in a refrigerator .
After it has recrystallized , pour off ( or slowly pipette off ) the supernatant until there is as little liquid as possible .
Then pour the remaining crystals into a clean , dry weigh boat ( that you have weighed and noted the weight for later use ) and let the remaining liquid evaporate overnight inside a laminar flow hood .
After all the liquid has evaporated , measure the weight boat again to get an approximate measurement of the amount of DMG you have recrystallized .
Calculate how much methanol is needed to add to the DMG in order to get a final concentration of 0.1 mol L-1 DMG , and obtain a trace metal clean bottle of the appropriate size .
Weigh the clean bottle , and then carefully transfer the recrystallized DMG into this clean bottle and re-weigh ( not all the DMG is easily transferred into the clean bottle , so the re-weigh is necessary ) .
Now recalculate the amount of optima methanol needed to get the desired concentration of 0.1 mol L-1 , and add that amount of optima methanol .
Make sure to test the reagent before use .

Generating Cas9-mediated fluorescent protein knock-ins with a self-excising selection cassette ( SEC )
See the Guidelines for : 1 .
Choosing the Cas9 targets site 2 .
Adding the target sequence to the Cas9 sgRNA construct 3 .
Designing primers to add homology arms to an FP SEC vector Grow bacteria carrying the FP SEC vector and miniprep the plasmid DNA .
Note that , prior to replacing the ccdB elements with homology arms , FP SEC vectors must be grown in cells that are resistant to ccdB ( ccdB Survival cells ) .
Digest an entire miniprep of FP SEC vector overnight at 37 C ( consult Table P1 for which construct and enzymes to use ) .
Purify the digested vector using a PCR cleanup spin column to remove the enzymes .
Process the entire digested vector as one sample ; do not attempt to gel purify individual bands .
The digested , purified vector may be stored at 4 C for at least a few months and reused to construct multiple repair templates .
Generate two PCR products ( the homology arms ) using genomic DNA as the template and the primers you designed above .
Mix the two PCR products and purify them together on a single PCR cleanup spin column .
Mix 1 L of vector , 4 L of homology arms and 5 L of isothemal assembly enzyme mix ( we use NEBuilder HiFi DNA assembly mix from NEB ) .
Incubate 1h @ 50 C or as directed by the enzyme manufacturer .
Transform 2 L of the reaction to suitable competent cells .
Isolate DNA from 3-6 clones and sequence with M13 Forward and Reverse primers to verify correct insertion of the homology arms .
Prepare an injection mix containing the following : 10 ng/ L homologous repair template , 50 ng/ L Cas9-sgRNA construct with your targeting sequence Fluorescent co-injection markers ( to label extrachromosomal arrays ) , 10 ng/ L pGH8 ( Prab-3 : :mCherry neuronal co-injection marker ; Addgene # 19359 ) , 5 ng/ L pCFJ104 ( Pmyo-3 : :mCherry body wall muscle co-injection marker ; Addgene # 19328 ) , 2.5 ng/ L pCFJ90 ( Pmyo-2 : :mCherry pharyngeal co-injection marker ; Addgene # 19327 ) .
Prepare plasmid DNA using Invitrogen s PureLink mini-prep kit , which gives high injection efficiencies .
Inject the mixture into the gonads of 50-60 young adult worms of strain N2 ( or substitute any strain you like ) .
Transfer the injected worms to new seeded plates ( three animals per plate works well in our hands ) .
Use regular NGM plates ( no drug ) at this stage .
Also make a control plate with uninjected worms , so that when you do the drug selection it can serve as a negative control .
Put the plates at 25 C and let the worms lay eggs without selection for 2-3 days .
Prepare and filter sterilize a 5 mg/mL hygromycin solution in water .
For 6 cm plates poured with 10 mL agar plates , pipet 500 L of drug onto the surface of each plate of worms , for a final concentration of ~250 g/mL ( if using different size plates , adjust the volume accordingly ) .
Swirl gently so that the solution covers the entire surface of the plate , then let it dry .
Put the worms back at 25 C .
Examine the plates and identify those that contain Roller ( Rol ) animals that survived the hygromycin treatment .
Candidate knock-in animals are L4/adults that 1 ) survive hygromycin selection ; 2 ) are Rol ; and 3 ) lack the red fluorescent extrachromosomal array markers .
Single 5-10 candidate knock-in adults to new plates without hygromycin .
Look for plates where 100 % of L4s and adults are Rollers .
( See the Guidelines for details . )
Pick 6-8 L1/L2 larvae to each of three new plates .
It is possible to perform marker excision using older animals , but using young larvae results in the highest efficiency because the germ cells have not yet begun to divide .
Heat shock the plates at 34 C for 4 hours ( or at 32 C for 4-5 hours ) in an air incubator to activate expression of hs : :Cre .
Return the plates to 20 C or 25 C .

Generating viral metagenomes from the coral holobiont
At Trunk Reef , approximately 45 g of coral tissue was sampled from three healthy , freshly collected coral colonies of Pocillopora damicornis .
Approximately 20 g of Acropora tenuis tissue was sampled from three healthy , freshly collected coral colonies collected in Pioneer Bay .
Fragments were washed in autoclaved , 0.02 m filtered virus-free seawater .
Subsequently , tissue was blasted from the coral skeleton , using an air-gun , into 15 mL 0.02 m filtered ( Anotop , Whatman ) SM buffer ( 100 mM NaCl , 8 mM MgSO4 , 50 mM Tris pH 7.5 ) in a zip-lock bag .
Briefly , 5 mL of chloroform per 40 mL of coral blastate was added and samples were agitated gently for 1 h at room temperature .
Coral blastates were homogenized at 5000 rpm for 1 min ( Heidolph SilentCrusher ) .
Samples were immediately centrifuged at 1000 g for 15 min .
The supernatant was transferred to sterile glass corex tubes and spun at 12,000 g for 15 min to pellet the majority of microbial cells ( Beckman Coulter JA 25.50 rotor ) .
A cesium chloride ( CsCl ) density gradient was then formed by layering 1 mL of 1.7 , 1.5 , and 1.35 g mL 1 CsCl into 13.2 mL UltraClear ultracentrifuge tubes ( Beckman Coulter ) with 9 mL sample layered on the top of the gradient .
Gradients were then centrifuged for 2 h at 60,000 g at 4 C in a swinging bucket rotor .
In the MECH method , the coral tissue blastate was homogenized at 10,000 rpm for 1 min .
The coral tissue blastate was then spun at 400 g for 5 min .
The supernatant was then aliquoted into 1.5 mL aliquots in 2 mL eppendorf tubes containing 0.3 mL acid-washed glass beads ( 425 600 m diameter ) ( Sigma-Aldrich ) .
The tubes were placed in a bead beater and cells were disrupted at 5000 rpm for 5 min .
Tubes were centrifuged at top speed in a bench-top Eppendorf centrifuge for 1 min .
The supernatant was collected for viral fractionation using step CsCl density gradients .
To confirm that the MECH method was not disrupting virus particles , two dsDNA viruses , OtV-2 ( Weynberg et al. , 2011 ) and EhV-86 ( Wilson et al. , 2005b ) , were subjected to the same mechanical disruption protocol .
Flow cytometry was used to enumerate viruses before and after disruption .
All samples were treated with DNase and RNase ( Ambion ) prior to nucleic acid extraction .
DNA was extracted and RNase treated using a MasterPure kit ( Epicentre , Illumina ) following manufacturer 's instructions .
RNA was extracted using a Qiagen QIAamp viral RNA kit ( Qiagen ) following manufacturer 's instructions , including the final DNase step ( Ambion ) .
Two different amplification methods were used .
In order to reduce some of the inherent biases in multi-displacement amplification ( MDA ) , such as a preference for ssDNA viral genomes , DNA extractions were converted to dsDNA prior to amplification .
Triplicate 10 L aliquots of the DNA extractions , containing ds and ssDNA viral genomes , underwent a single round of Klenow reaction ( 3 5 exo- , 5U/ L ) by mixing 1.5 L of 10 reaction buffer ( New England Biolabs Buffer 2 ) , 1.5 L of dNTPs ( 2.5 mM stock ) , 1 L of random hexamer primers ( 50 ng/ L , Invitrogen ) .
The reaction was incubated at 94 C for 3 min .
The reaction was then placed on ice for 3 min to allow for primer annealing .
1 L of Klenow ( 3 5 exo- ) was added and incubated at 25 C for 10 min .
It was then incubated at 37 C for 60 min .
It was then incubated with a termination step of 75 C for 20 min .
After termination , reactions were pooled and cleaned using a Qiagen QIAamp DNA mini kit and eluted in 50 L of Buffer AE .
Replicate MDA reactions ( n = 3 for each sample ) were amplified using 2.5 L dsDNA template and the Qiagen RepliG kit using the standard protocol .
All reactions were run on a 0.8 % agarose gel in 1 TAE at 100 V for 30 min to confirm amplification , pooled and cleaned with QIAampl DNA minikit and eluted in 200 L of Buffer AE .
Negative controls were treated the same and also sent for sequencing to confirm that no viral contamination was present .
As with the RepliG protocol , Klenow Fragment ( 3 5 exo- ) was used to convert all DNA genomes to dsDNA using RP-SISPA primers with a 3 random hexamer sequence that is used for downstream PCR amplification .
To label the first strand with the RP-SISPA primer , 5 L of nucleic acid was added to 9 L reaction mix containing : .
The reaction was incubated at 94 C for 3 min .
The reaction was then placed on ice for 3 min to allow for primer annealing .
1 L of Klenow Fragment ( 3 5 exo- , 5U/ L , NEB # ) was added and incubated at 37 C for 60 min .
A second round of Klenow Fragment reaction ( 3 5 exo ) labeled the second strand with the SISPA primer , by adding an additional 1 L of primer and 1 L dNTP .
The reaction then underwent a 94 C for 3 min heating step .
The reaction was then put on ice for 3 min .
The reaction then underwent a final addition of 1 L of Klenow Fragment ( 3 5 exo- ) .
The reaction was incubated at 37 C for 60 min .
The reaction was then terminated at 75 C for 20 min .
Briefly , in preparation for cDNA synthesis , 10 L purified RNA viral template was mixed with 1 L of 2.5 mM dNTPs and 1.3 L of FR26RV-N ( GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGATATCNNNNNN , 10 M stock ) and FR40RV-T primer ( GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGATATC ( T ) 20 , 50 nM stock ) .
The reaction was heated to 65 C for 5 min .
The reaction was then cooled on ice for 3 min to allow the primers to anneal .
While still on ice , 1 L DTT ( Invitrogen ) was added to the reaction as an enzyme stabilization reagent with 1 L RNase OUT ( Invitrogen ) to protect the sample from RNAse activity .
The complementary DNA strand was synthesized with 200 U of Superscript III reverse transcriptase .
The reaction was incubated initially at 25 C for 10 min to allow annealing of the hexamer 3 end of primer FR26RV-N and the poly ( T ) 20 3 end of primer FR40RV-T to the template while cDNA synthesis commenced .
The temperature was then increased to 50 C for 60 min .
The first strand synthesis reaction was heated immediately to 94 C for 3 min and then rapidly cooled on ice .
A complementary second strand was subsequently synthesized at 37 C for 60 min with the addition of 1 L Klenow Fragment ( 3 5 exo- , 5U/ L ) .
The Klenow reaction was terminated with a final incubation at 75 C for 20 min .
PCR amplification of the SISPA primer labeled template ( DNA and RNA ) was done in triplicate 25 L reactions containing : .
The reaction was incubated at 95 C for 10 min .
The reaction then underwent 30 cycles of denaturation at : .
The PCR reactions were loaded on to a 0.8 % agarose gel in 1 TAE at 100 V for 30 min .
If amplification resulted in visible PCR products ( typically a smear ; products should be longer than 250 bp ) , a reconditioning PCR was performed on pooled reactions as follows .
One reconditioning PCR contained 10 L of pooled SISPA reaction template , 10 L 10 buffer , 16 L dNTP ( 2.5 mM stock ) , 8 L FR20RV primer ( 10 M stock ) and 0.75 L TaKaRa LA HS Taq .
The reaction was incubated at 95 C for 10 min .
The reaction then underwent 5 cycles of denaturation at : .
Reactions were cleaned and QC was assessed .
After amplification , samples were cleaned with a QIAamp DNA Mini kit ( RepliG amplification ) or a MinElute PCR purification kit ( RP-SISPA ) .
Samples were checked for quantification using a Quant-iT PicoGreen kit on a NanoDrop 3300 fluorospecrometer , for quality ( 260:280 ratios ) on a NanoDrop 2000 , and were run on a 0.8 % agarose gel in 1 TAE at 100 V for 30 min to confirm a size range appropriate for sequencing ( ~250 500 bp ) was present without contamination of smaller fragments .
All metagenomes were sequenced using Nextera XT MiSeq 250 bp paired-end sequencing ( Illumina ) at the Ramaciotti Centre , University of New South Wales , Sydney , Australia .
Raw sequence reads were processed in CLC Genomics Workbench 5.5 .
Sequences were imported as Illumina paired-end reads , adaptor sequences were trimmed , and reads were checked for quality using a PHRED score of 20 and a minimum length of 100 bp .
Paired reads were merged and a final data set containing merged reads and ORFans was checked again for QC with a minimum length of 200 bp .
To carry out the taxonomic assignment , these non-assembled read data sets were uploaded to the Metavir web server , which is dedicated to the analysis of viral metagenomes ( http : //metavir-meb.univ-bpclermont.fr ) ( Roux et al. , 2011 ) .
All virus sequences were further classified into families using the taxonomic information from the top BLAST hit .
Tetranucleotide clustering and rarefaction curves were generated using tools available through Metavir .
The five datasets generated from the P. damicornis samples were submitted to Genbank Sequence Read Archive ( SRA ) and are available under the accession numbers SRR1207981 , SRR1207983 , SRR1207980 , SRR1207984 , and SRR1246941 ( Table 1 in guidelines ) .
The two datasets generated from the A. tenuis samples have also been deposited in the SRA under the accession numbers SRR1207979 and SRR1210582 .

Time Efficient Method for Washing 15 mL Vials
Arrange vials so that they all sit upright in a large plastic cage .
I ve found you can usually fit about 60 vials ( a bit more than one bag ) into a single cage .
Place caps into a small cage .
Place cages upright into a soap bath overnight .
Place a large piece of PTFE over the cages to keep them submerged .
Remove cages from soap , and rinse thoroughly 7 times to remove soap .
It s important to make sure that water gets into each individual vial , so move the cage back and forth until each of the vials is at least partially filled .
When pouring the water back out , make sure to shake the cage so that in interior of all the vials is rinsed .

Optiprep gradient preparation for virus separation
Optiprep preparation UV and sterilize class II cabinet with reagent alcohol .
Work with gloves and sleeve guards to prevent contaminating the hood .
Label 5 15ml falcon tubes with 25 % , 30 % , 35 % , 40 % and 45 % labels .
Label a 50 ml falcon tube `` Optiprep '' .
Remove OptiPrep solution from the fridge and wipe down sides , cap and septum with alcohol .
Pierce septum with needle ( 20 gauge 1/2 inch needles work best ) attached to appropriately-sized syringe and aseptically remove 15-16 ml of OptiPrep for every 2 gradients you intend to make .
Place Optiprep in the sterile 50 ml falcon tube .
Make 25 % , 30 % , 35 % , 40 % and 45 % Optiprep solutions in the labeled falcon tubes .
You will need 2.5 ml of each solution for every gradient you plan to make .
Mix well .
For example , if you are making 2 gradients , you will prepare 5 ml of each solution as follows : 25 % = 3 ml media + 2 ml Optiprep30 % = 2.5 ml media + 2.5 ml OptiPrep35 % = 2.1 ml media + 2.9 ml OptiPrep40 % = 1.7 ml media + 3.3 ml OptiPrep45 % = 1.25 ml media + 3.75 ml OptiPrep .
Make a loading system for the centrifuge tubes by attaching the thin end of a pasteur pipet to a 5 ml syringe with parafilm or a rubber tube .
Hold the syringe with a ring clamp so that the end of the Pasteur pipet tip hovers just above the bottom of the tube .
Pipette 2.4 ml of 25 % solution into the syringe .
It will begin to flow into the centrifuge tube via gravity .
When nearly all the solution has left the syringe , add 2.4 ml of the 30 % .
Repeat for all solutions .
NOTE : Try not to let the syringe run dry as it will introduce air bubbles into the tube and disrupting the reagent .
If this happens , you can restart the flow by placing your thumb on the top of the syringe to generate and seal and then move your thumb up and down to increase the pressure in the syringe .
Once all tube has been poured ( all percent solutions have been added ) , seal the top with parafilm and place the tubes in the fridge .
Allow the tubes to sit overnight to form a continuous gradient .
NOTE : Tubes may sit in the fridge for several weeks and will still be good as long as they are sealed .
Separating viruses on the Optiprep gradient .
The next morning , pipette 0.5 - 4 ml of your viral concentrate onto each gradient .
Balance the tubes using sterile growth medium if necessary ( or whatever solution the virus sample is suspended in ) .
Centrifuge the tubes in a swinging bucket rotor in the Beckman Advanti J30-I ( use rotor JS-25.15 ) at max speed ( 40,000 rpm ) for at least 4 hours at 8 C .
NOTE : Occasionally you will need to spin for longer than 4 hours to achieve separation .
In these cases an overnight or 24 hour spin may be required .
Remove the tubes carefully out of the rotor and place them on a standing clamp to visualize the bands .
NOTE : Sometimes the bands are not visible until you suspend the tubes in a beaker of water , remove and back light them .
Extracting bands .
Extract the bands separately using sterile needles and a 3 ml syringe .
NOTE : You must use 20 gauge half-inch needles at this stage to avoid puncturing both walls of the tube !
Do not use any needles longer than .
Wipe the sides of the tube wall with ethanol .
Place the syringe just below the band and puncture the wall .
Aspirate and remove the band with the syringe until the band disappears .
It usually results in about 400 ul 1 ml volume removed .
Place a piece of scotch tape over the hole in the tube to prevent the gradient from leaking out .
Place the sample into a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube and store at 4 C until ready to use .
NOTE : If you have multiple bands , extract in the order from lowest to highest .
This will prevent any leakage from the puncture site from possibly contaminating the wall next to your lower bands .

Protocol for SYBR Counts of Cyanophages and Bacteria Make dilutions of the sample ( s ) .
Record volume of samples used .
Custom has been to use 20 l of phage stocks or 200 l of cells diluted to 2 ml with autoclaved seawater .
If the final slides appear too sparse or dense then the volume of sample used can be adjusted accordingly .
Remove the 10 % SYBR and phenylenediamine from the freezer .
Keep the stocks away from light ( such as in a drawer ) while they are thawing .
Connect the glass flask to the vacuum pump .
Attach the filter holder so that the grout is flat and level with the table .
Place a 0.8 m filter on top of the grout .
Make sure it is completely flat and centered , with no air bubbles underneath ( pre-wetting the grout helps ) .
This filter can be used many times so long as it stays intact and flat .
Place the 0.02 m filter on top of the 0.8 m filter .
Again , make sure it is flat and centered with no air bubbles underneath .
Turning on the vacuum for a brief while can help achieve this .
Clamp the funnel on top of the filters .
Add the sample and turn on the pump ( pressure should be ~20 kPa or 7 mmHg ) .
After the last liquid passes through the funnel and clamp should be removed with the vacuum still on .
Turn off the vacuum ; remove 0.02 m filter .
Keep track of which side of the filter is the top .
Blot out any seawater on the bottom or the top plastic rim with a kimwipe .
It is very important to make sure the filters are completely dry before continuing .
It is a good idea to rub the back of the filter with a kimwipe and then stick it in a dessicator ( we used a makeshift box with some drying rocks ) for a few minutes .
Prepare a 100 L drop of SYBR , made fresh from 2.5 L 10 % stock + 97.5 L 0.02 m filtered deionized water , on the bottom of a plastic Petri dish .
Lay the 0.02 Anodisc filters sample side up on the drops of the SYBR staining solution for 15 minutes in a dark drawer or box .
While waiting it may be a good time to prepare the antifade solution .
Dry completely as in steps 7-8 .
Do not touch the top of the filter .
Place the filter sample-side up on a glass slide .
Place 30 L of antifade on a cover slip ; then invert slip and place on top of the filter .
Appy pressure to ensure that the antifade fills the space underneath the square .
View with blue excitation .
Examine at least ten fields in the microscope ( We usually examine 20 ) .
Count at least 200 viruses or bacteria total for ten fields ( 400 for 20 fields ) .
Field size may be full ( counting all particles in all 100 small squares ) or smaller ( e.g . 5 small squares ) , depending on the virus/bacteria concentration .
Find the average number of particles per quadrant ( 25 small squares ) .
Multiply this by a scaling factor of 1.26 x 105 to get the total number of particles on the filter .
Divide this by the volume used ( e.g . 20 L ) to get the titer in particles per ml .

Nutrient deplete/replete algal culture for elemental analysis
Culture Preparation/GrowthComparative measurements depend on having well-characterized culture growth .
Initiate an experimental culture to allow for at least 7 generations of characterized exponential growth ( 10 generations is the gold standard ) prior to centrifugation and resuspension .
Monitor growth daily , including transfer/dilution to pre-determined mid-exponential density ( i.e. , semi-continuous culture ) until target biomass is reached .
A safe estimate for the target biomass is to assume ~10 % recovery of cells after centrifugation and washing ( this is strain dependent ) .
Ensure cell density remains within the exponential range by increasing culture volume ( not cell density ) when ramping up to target biomass .
Example Ostreococcus lucimarinus ( CCMP2972A ) culture preparation :
Growth conditions : 18 C , 14:10 hour light : dark cycle , light irradiance of ~100 E m-2 s-1 .
Growth media : L1 with natural seawater base .

NOTE : Extra-large volumes used for omics experiment Concentration and Resuspension .
When target culture biomass has been reached , split volume evenly among 2 or 4 acid-cleaned and autoclaved centrifuge bottles .
Weigh and balance bottles by removing volume until bottle pairs are within 0.01 g of each other .
Only open bottles in hood to maintain axenicity !
Carry bottles over to Sorvall RC 26 Plus centrifuge .
Fit centrifuge with large rotor ( accomodates 4 centrifuge bottles ) .
Make sure pins are offset when rotor is placed into the centrifuge .
Place paired bottles opposite of each other in the rotor and tighten the lid .
Spin at the following settings : Rotor = GS-3 ( choose option code 03 ) , Speed = 7300 RPM ( equivalent to 10,000 rcf with this large rotor ) , Time = 0:32 minutes ( includes 2 minute ramp up ) , *strain specificTemp = +20/+25 C , ( will try to maintain lower temp , and shut down at max temp ) .
After the spin , carefully transport the bottles back to hood , taking care not to resuspend the cell pellets/smears .
Gently pour off the supernatant into a waste container , trying to disturb the cell smear as little as possible .
Resuspend/wash cells with a volume of nutrient deplete medium equivalent to the initial culture volume in each bottle .
Repeat 2-8.Resuspend cells with a volume of nutrient deplete medium that is ~5 % of the initial culture volume in each bottle .
Run a sample of the cell concentrate in the Accuri to determine density .
Store cells at normal growth conditions during Accuri run and calculations .
Experimental Culture Initiation .
Calculate appropriate volume based on Accuri measurement to inoculate experimental nutrient replete and deplete culture flasks from the cell concentrate at a starting density corresponding to early-exponential growth .
NOTE : It helps to have some amount of media pre-aliquoted to experimental flasks .
Adjust as needed to achieve target density and volume .
Once all experimental cultures have been inoculated , mix and sample for FCM and Accuri measurements to monitor growth daily .
When the average daily growth rate of the nutrient deplete cultures ( GRDEP ) , is reduced to half or less of the growth rate of the replete cultures ( GRDEP/GRREP < 0.5 ) , collect samples for FCM ( i.e. , cell counts ) and elemental analyses ( i.e. , particulate carbon/nitrogen and phosphorus , as well as dissolved nutrients ) .
