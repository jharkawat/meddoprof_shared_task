Hot-phenol RNA Extraction
Transfer 12-15 mL of culture to a 50 mL conical tube ( 10 mL of culture at stationary phase ) and add 25 mL of ice to tube .
The ice will help to slow transcription .
Immediately pellet at ~10,000x g and 4 C for 10 minutes and discard the supernatant .
Flash freeze the pellet in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 C until extraction .
Resuspend the pellet in 600 L of solution A and vortex to mix completely .
Solution A contains 0.5 % SDS , 20 mM sodium acetate , 10 mM EDTA in RNase-free water .
Immediately add to 500 L acid phenol : chloroform preheated to 65 C .
Vortex .
Incubate at 65 C for 10 min .
Centrifuge the cells at 21,000 x g ( or maximum g in a benchtop microcentrifuge ) at room temperature for 10 min .
Carefully remove the supernatant .
Extract supernatant again with 500 L hot acid phenol : chloroform .
Incubation is not needed in this extraction .
Remove supernatant and extract with room temperature phenol : chloroform : isoamyl alcohol to remove any remaining protein contamination .
One or two extractions may be needed to clear the protein contamination .
Extract twice with 400 L of chloroform to remove residual phenol .
Place the supernatent into a clean tube and add 2.5 volumes of ice-cold 100 % ethanol to the sample .
Place in -80 C freezer for at least 15 min .
Sample can be stored in this condition as needed
Centrifuge the samples at 21,000 x g ( or maximum g in a benchtop microcentrifuge ) at 4 C for 30 min .
Decant liquid .
Add 400 L of 70 % ethanol to wash the RNA pellet .
Dislodge the pellet from the centrifuge tube wall but do not attempt to completely resuspend .
Centrifuge at maximum for 15 min .
Carefully aspirate the liquid and allow the pellet to air dry to remove all ethanol .
Resuspend in ~50 L of RNase-free water .
Volume of water will depend on expected RNA recovery and desired dissolved RNA concentration .
Add 50 g of RNA to a total volume of 85 L of RNase-free water .
Add 10 L of Turbo DNA-free 10x buffer .
Add 5 L of Turbo DNase enzyme .
Incubate at 37 C for 20 min .
Bring volume to 200 L using RNase-free water .
Add 200 L of phenol : chlorofform and extract one time as described above .
To supernatant , add 20 L of 3M sodium acetate and 750 L of 100 % ethanol .
Precipitate RNA as described above .
