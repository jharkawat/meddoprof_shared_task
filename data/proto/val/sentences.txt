Construction of shotgun libraries from RNA virus assemblages
Cesium chloride gradient is conducted to purify viruses from viral concentrate of seawater as described in others chapters of this book ( Wommack et al . 2010 , this volume ; Steward and Culley 2010 , this volume ) .
Each density fraction is then extracted with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit ( Qiagen ) as directed by the manufacturer with the following exception ( see annotation ) .
Remove contaminating DNA from RNA preparations with the Turbo DNAfree kit ( Applied Biosystems ) as described in the protocol provided with the kit .
In preparation for cDNA synthesis , 10 L purified RNA viral template is mixed with a final dNTP concentration of 0.2 mM and 1 M and 5 nM final concentrations of FR26RV-N and FR40RV-T primer , respectively .
The reaction is heated to 65 C then cooled on ice to allow the primers to anneal .
While still on ice , DTT ( 0.5 mM final conc . ) is added to the reaction as an enzyme stabilization reagent with 40 U RNase OUT ( Invitrogen ) to protect the sample form RNAse activity .
The complementary DNA strand is synthesized with 200 U of Superscript III ( Invitrogen ) reverse transcriptase .
The reaction is incubated initially at 25 C for 10 min so that the hexamer 3 end of primer FR26RV-N and the poly ( T ) 20 3 end of primer FR40RV-T remain annealed to the template while cDNA synthesis commences .
The temperature is then increased to 50 C , the temperature at which Superscript III s processivity is highest , for 60 min .
After the hour-long incubation at 50 C , the first strand synthesis reaction is heated immediately to 94 C for 3 min and then rapidly cooled on ice .
A complementary second strand is subsequently synthesized at 37 C for 60 min with the addition of 2.5 U of Klenow Fragment , 3 -5 exo ( New England Biolabs ) .
The Klenow reaction is terminated with a final incubation at 75 C for 10 min .
One PCR reaction contains 5 L of template taken directly from the second strand synthesis reaction , 40 pM of FR20RV primer ( see Table 1 ) , a final dNTP concentration of 0.2 mM , 1 Gold buffer , 2.5 mM MgCl2 , and 2.5 U of Ampligold DNA polymerase ( Applied Biosystems ) in a final volume of 50 L .
The reaction is incubated at 94 C for 10 min to fully denature the template and activate the hot start enzyme .
Followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 C for 1 min .
Annealing at 65 C for 1 min .
Extension at 72 C for 2 min .
A final extension for 13 min that permits the completion of complementary strand synthesis .
Before gel separation , we purify and concentrate the PCR reactions with a MinElute PCR cleanup column ( Qiagen ) as described by the manufacturer .
Purified PCR products are loaded onto a 1 % agarose gel containing 1 SYBR safe stain ( Invitrogen ) and 0.5 TBE buffer .
Bands of DNA of the appropriate size range are excised and purified with a MinElute Gel Extraction kit ( Qiagen ) according to the manufacturer s instructions .
If the sample is to be cloned for Sanger sequencing , we recommend eluting DNA from the column with three washes of 10 L nuclease-free water in preparation for the PCRTerminator ( Lucigen ) end repair reaction .
For the cloning protocol , please refer to the Cloning and sequencing section of `` A degenerate primer reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction based protocol to determine the diversity of picorna-like viruses '' .

Fix cells according to standard protocols [ 34 ] immediately after sampling either by ( 1 ) fixation in 3 % formaldehyde ( PFA ) in PBS ( See Steps 3-6 ) or ( 2 ) by resuspending pelleted biomass in a 1:1 mix of PBS : EtOH .
( See Step 7 ) For fixation with PFA , pellet the biomass , remove the supernatant ( SN ) , and resuspend cells in 3 % PFA in PBS .
For aqueous samples , directly add PFA to reach a final concentration of 3 % PFA .
Fix for either 3 h on ice or 1 h at RT .
After fixation , Pellet the biomass by centrifugation or filter onto 0.2 m filters .
Wash with PBS to remove remaining PFA before resuspending biomass in 1:1 PBS : EtOH .
Store at -20 C .
Make sure to deposit PFA in the chemical waste .

Add 1.5 mL 96 % EtOH , mix by vortex , and incubate for 3 min at RT .
Afterwards , pellet sample via centrifugation and resuspend in 221 L PBS .
Removing small volumes of leftover EtOH is not necessary as it does not interfere with the click reaction .
If using immobilized biomass , after dehydration of the sample , prepare the dye premix by mixing 1.25 L of 20 mM CuSO4 solution with 2.50 L of 50 mM THPTA and 0.30 L of alkyne dye .
Allow to react for 3 min at RT in the dark .
We recommend to perform Cu ( I ) -catalyzed click chemistry at a dye concentration of 1-5 M ( final concentration ) to guarantee for best signal-to-noise ratios , but substantially lower or higher concentrations can be used , if necessary .
We successfully tested concentrations as low as 10 nM and as high as 50 M .
If using immobilized biomass after dehydration , continue .
Otherwise , skip to Step 18 .
Add 12.5 L of each 100 mM sodium ascorbate and 100 mM aminoguanidine hydrochloride to 221 L PBS .
Then , add the dye premix and invert the tube once ( do not mix by vortex to maintain reducing conditions ) .
Cover the sample with 20 L of the click solution , transfer the slide into a humid chamber ( water on tissue paper ) , and incubate in the dark at RT for 30 min .
Increasing the incubation time is possible , but typically does not increase fluorescence signal .
Wash the slide or filter three times for 3 min each in PBS-filled 50 mL tubes before dehydrating it by incubating it for 3 min in 50 % EtOH at RT .
If the biomass is in solution , all reagents ( sodium ascorbate and aminoguanidine , followed after 3 min by the dye premix , final concentrations as described above ) are added directly to the sample .
Invert tubes once and incubate in the dark at RT for 30 min .
Afterwards , wash samples three times with PBS and then one time in 50 % EtOH ( RT ) .

If 1 ml aliquots made ( equivalent to 4 sporangia ) , use half a plate per transformation .
Grow upside down ( rhizoids will grow away from the media ) for 5-6 days at 21 C CL 150 E Sporelings ( germinated spores ) have red fluoresence from chlorophyll autofluorescence after ~ 3 days .
Agro transformation :
Mix DNA and Agro : For each agro transformation , add 20-50ng of plasmid to 50 L of thawed electrocompetent Agrobacterium cells ( kept on ice ) .
Electroporate in a chilled 2 mm cuvette with a 2.5 kV pulse .
Recover Agro : Immediately add 1mL of SOC ( or LB ) and incubate 1-2h at 28 C 150 rpm .
Plate Agro : Streak 20-50 L on LB plates + antibiotics ( Kan 50 , Tet 5 , for GV2260 with a pGreen plasmid ) .
Each Agro transformation in a different plate .
Grow for 3 days at 28 C or 30 C , incubator .
Optional Agro colony PCR : all agrobacterium colonies on LB + antibiotics plates should be positive , however if there are some issues with the transformations it may be useful to do a quick screen to check if there are any false positives on the plate .
In that case , do a colony PCR of Agro colonies .
Grow Agro culture : ( ~ 15 '' set up sometime in the afternoon ) For each Agro transformation pick a single colony from plate , inoculate 5 ml LB media + antibiotics ( Kan 50 , Tet 5 for GV2260 with a pGreen plasmid ) in a 15 ml falcon tube ( unskirted tube ) .
Incubate at 28 C - 150 rpm ( wrap the tubes in foil ) and let grow for 1.5 days .
Agro induction with Acetosyringone : ( ~20 '' plus 6 h induction set up in the morning ) : Centrifuge the agrobacterium culture ( s ) 10 '' at 3000g .
For each agrobacterium culture , discard the supernatant and re-suspend in 3 ml of 1/2 GB media sup containing 100 M Acetosyringone .
Add acetosyringone to a final concentration of 100 M ( for 3ml media add 3 l 100 mM stock solution ) .
Shake for 6 h at 28 C at 150 rpm in the dark ( wrap the tubes in foil ) .
Agro co-Cultivation with sporelings .
Scrape the 6 days old sporelings from the plate using an L shaped spreader , gather the sporelings and move them into a 100-250 ml autoclaved flask .
Use one plate per flask ( transformation ) if you plated 2 sporangia per plate , or half a plate if you plated 4 sporangia per plate .
Add to each flask 25 ml of 1/2 GB media sup and 25 ul of 100mM Acetosyringone , for a final concentration of 100 M .
To each flask , add 1ml of the appropiate Agrobacterium culture ( induced 6 h prior ) .
Co-cultivate for 2 days ( at least 36 h or 1.5 days ) on a shaker in the tissue culture room ( 21 C , CL 150-200 uE ) Sporelings Collection .
Add cefotaxime 100mg/ml stock solution to sterile water for a final concentration of 100ug/ml , 150-200 ml are needed per flask of co-cultivation .
For each co-cultivation flask ( transformation ) , collect the sporelings by pouring the flask contents in a 70 m cell strainer placed on a 1L bottle .
Rinse the sporeling by pouring over them 150-200ml of water + cefo 100 Sporelings plating .
For each co-cultivation flask ( transformation ) , with the help of a tip and a few ml of water + cefo remove the sporelings from the cell strainer and spread them on at least 3 plates ( 1/2 GB plates with antibiotics ) , make sure they are well spread , the better the spread the better the transgenic plants will grow .
Screening for transformants : Positive transformants grow while non-trasnformed sporelings die .
Positive transformants become evident from about 1 week after plating .
Positive transformants with a fluorescent marker in the T-DNA can start to be screened under the microscope after about 5 daysOnce positive transformants have grown , from about a week and a half onwards , they should be transferred to new 1/2 GB plates with antibiotics , so they can grow faster and make gemmae

Concentration of Phage Lysate using Vivaflow Tangential/Crossflow Filtration Cassette
To filter 4-8 L of phage lysate , set up one Vivaflow50 cassette per 4 L of sample ( this was the capacity successfully tested by our lab ) .
If two cassettes are needed for a phage sample , set these up in parallel with separate tubing lines , using the double tubing pump head .
Refer to the Sartorius user manual and online videos for tubing attachment and flow set-up .
For all tubing , keep the ends to be placed in the sample and filtrate as clean as possible once removing from the packaging .
To adapt the smaller cassette tubing to our lab s pump head size , make sure to attach the size 25 Masterflex tubing first .
Keep clean/sterile the end to be placed in the phage sample .
If running more than one phage sample simultaneously , make sure to label all input and output tubing , cassettes and bottles or flasks with sample ID s , and keep separate to prevent any phage cross contamination .
Per the Sartorius manual , prepare the cassette ( aka : module ) before use by pre-rinsing the system at full pressure to remove trace amounts of glycerine and sodium azide and check for any leaks at the tubing connections .
Place the input tubing into the 1 L bottle of 0.2 um filtered , sterile nanopure water .
Place the output return tubing in the same bottle and pump liquid through the system to purge any air pockets .
You will need ~500 ml of water per cassette , and you can set up two parallel cassettes to use the same bottle .
The recirculation rate should be in the range of 200-400 ml/min and suitable flow should exit the filtrate line .
If used , the pressure indicator should read approximately 2.5 bar .
This corresponds to a pump setting of around 60 .
Allow 400 ml per cassette to pass into the filtrate collection .
Check for any leaks at connections .
Finally , drain the system and empty the filtrate flask .
To concentrate the phage sample , place the input and output lines into the initial lysate container ( usually a 1L bottle ) .
If the container lid is off , place a piece of parafilm over the opening to minimize contamination and secure the tubing in place .
Pump the liquid through the system at the same rate and pressure as specified for the rinsing step above .
For two cassettes filtering one sample , a pump setting of around 60 corresponds to a filtrate production of about 250 ml per 14 min initially , but which may slow some as more concentrated sample is added to the recirculation .
Monitor the sample level and stop the pumping when volume reaches 100-200 ml to refill the bottle with more sample .
Also monitor the filtrate flask to prevent overflowing and discard ( or keep , if desired ) the filtrate down the sink ( this should be free of phage ! ) .
Stop adding phage sample after you have concentrated 4 L to between 175 and 200 ml .
Note that about 15-20 ml are left in the system .
When the desired volume has been reached , reduce the recirculation rate to 20-40 ml/min ( pump setting around 10 ) and recirculate the concentrated sample for 1-2 minutes to maximize recovery .
Stop adding phage sample after you have concentrated 4 L to between 175 and 200 ml .
Note that about 15-20 ml are left in the system .
When the desired volume has been reached , reduce the recirculation rate to 20-40 ml/min ( pump setting around 10 ) and recirculate the concentrated sample for 1-2 minutes to maximize recovery .
If there are > 4 L of sample to concentrate , begin the next fraction : place the input and return tubes into the next lysate sample bottle , parafilm cover , and repeat the concentration process ( steps 5-8 ) .
Then transfer the concentrated sample into a second 250 ml bottle and drain the remaining sample completely from the system .
To collect a final rinse from the filters for a more complete sample recovery , place 100 ml ASW salts into a clean 250 ml bottle .
Place the input and return tubing into the bottle , cover the top with parafilm and recirculate on lower speed until the volume is reduced to about 20 ml .
Then drain the system as before and collect the remaining rinse fraction into the bottle .
Even though the Vivaflow 50 cassettes are not reusable , they were kept until the concentration of phage sample was determined .
To store the cassettes , load them with ASW salts and keep at 4 C .
Place 50 ml ASW salts into a sterile 50 ml tube and recirculate this through the filter and tubing to remove air bubbles .
Then either leave the open tubing ends in the media tube and cover with parafilm , or seal the tubing ends with tape .
For phage concentration analysis via SYBR slide preparation , collect 0.5 ml of each of the following samples .
Sample Fractions # 1 , # 2 and Rinse .

The second fraction was more concentrated for both phage samples .
The rinse sample was not counted or used .
2 ) In all previous Vivaflow concentration trials , no particles were seen on SYBR slides for the filtrate samples , as should be expected .

Enumeration of virus particles in aquatic or sediment samples by epifluorescence microscopy
Prepare reagents .
Collect and prepare sample according to sample type .
Prepare slide labels with critical information such as the date , sample location , and volume filtered to keep track of the samples once they have been filtered and stained .
For every set of four samples to be stained , use a permanent pen to mark the bottom of a plastic Petri plate into four labeled sections .
For each filter that is to be prepared , add a 78- L drop of 0.02- m filtered dH2O on each section of the marked Petri plates .
Thaw a 40- L vial of the stock SYBR solution and add 2 L stock solution to each drop ( 78 L ) of sterile dH2O or buffer .
Mix the stain by gently pipetting up and down .
Place the Petri plates in the dark so that the stain is not bleached .
Prepare the antifade solution in a clean , sterilized 2-mL microcentrifuge tube .
Dilute the 10 % ( wt/vol ) stock of p-phenylenediamine 1:100 using glycerol/PBS as the diluent .
Keep the solution on ice and protect it from light .
For each filter that is to be prepared , add a 80- L drop of thawed Yo-Pro working solution on each section of the marked Petri plates .
Place a 9-cm-diameter filter paper soaked with 3 mL aqueous NaCl solution ( 0.3 % wt/vol ) in the lid of the Petri plates to prevent evaporation of the stain .
Connect a filtration unit for 25-mm filters to a vacuum source , ensuring the vacuum is 13 kPa .
Place a 0.45- m nitrocellulose backing filter on each filter support , and overlay it with a thin layer of dH2O .
Carefully pick up a 0.02- m Anodisc filter by its plastic ring and lay it over the wet backing filter , with the plastic ring facing upward .
If the sample has been preserved and frozen as described , thaw it in a 37 C water bath .
For a sample that has just been collected , fix it with 0.5 % glutaraldehyde for 15 30 min at 4 C before preparing slides .
In addition , prepare duplicate control samples by fixing 1 mL of the 0.02- m filtered water that was used to dilute the SYBR stain .
Because divalent cations interfere with the binding of the stain , seawater samples should be diluted to < 7 psu with 0.02- m filtered dH2O before filtration .
It is a good idea to make test slides ( including a control with no sample added ) to be sure an appropriate volume is filtered , that the procedure is working , and that the filters and reagents do not have viruses on or in them ( some batches of Anodiscs have been covered with bacteria and viruses ) .
For most lake and coastal seawater samples , which have viral abundances of ~107 mL 1 , 0.8 1.0 mL sample is added to the surface of the Anodisc filter while the vacuum is off .
Turn on the vacuum and suck the sample through the filter .
For oligotrophic or very deep ocean samples , it may be necessary to filter 4 mL or more .
Filter towers must be cleaned between samples .
Rinse the towers with 0.02- m filtered dH2O followed by ethanol .
Dry with lint-free paper ( e.g. , Kimwipe ) .
Once the sample is filtered , remove the Anodisc with the vacuum still on .
Allow the filter to air-dry ( typically a minute or less ) , until the surface is visibly dry .
Place the Anodisc , sample side up , on a drop of stain in the Petri dish .
Allow the filter to stain for 15 min in the dark .
Allow the filter to stain for 48 h in the dark , at room temperature .
Add a drop of dH2O on the backing filter , lay the stained Anodisc on top , and use the vacuum to remove any remaining fluid .
Some samples ( e.g. , sediments , vent fluid , and humic waters ) may require the filters to be rinsed to reduce background fluorescence .
If so , while the vacuum is still on and the filter is damp , rinse the filter twice with 1 mL of 0.02- m filtered dH2O .
Remove the Anodisc while the vacuum is on .
Place the Anodisc , sample-side up , on a 9-cm filter paper or Kimwipe in the dark , and allow the filter to dry until it appears opaque .
Place 12 15 L antifade solution on a labeled glass slide and lay the dry Anodisc on top .
Add ~20 L antifade on top of the Anodisc and cover with a coverslip .
Place 12 15 L spectrophotometric-grade glycerol on a labeled glass slide and lay the dry Anodisc on top .
Add ~20 L glycerol on top of the Anodisc and cover with a coverslip .
Remove any air bubbles that are trapped under the coverslip by gently pressing on the surface .
The slides can be counted immediately or stored frozen at 20 C for at least 4 months with no decrease in estimates of viral abundance .
Count the viruses at 1000 magnification using a 100 oilemersion objective .
Begin by checking the test filters to ensure that the reagents or filters were not contaminated and the filtered volumes were appropriate .
Check each slide before counting to make sure that the filter is evenly stained and that the viruses are on a single plane of focus and not suspended in the mounting medium and are evenly distributed across the filter .
Using the ocular reticule , select an appropriate number of grid squares so that there are 10 100 stained viruses in each field .
Estimate the abundance of viruses by counting at least 20 random fields .
Keep a tally of the number of particles in each field so that the variation in abundance of particles among fields can be determined .
For each sample , record the number of particles counted in each field , the number of fields counted , the area of the field , and the volume of sample filtered .
The abundance of viruses mL 1 ( Vt ) in the sample = Vc Fc At Af S , where Vc = total number of viruses counted , Fc = total number of fields counted , At = surface area of the filter ( m2 ) ( see note below ) , Af = area of each field ( m2 ) , and S = volume of sample filtered ( mL ) .
The total number of particles counted will determine the size of the 95 % confidence intervals on the estimates of viral abundance .
By assuming a Poisson distribution , the 95 % confidence intervals can be estimated using the following equations ( Suttle 1993 ) :
Electron microscopy for virus identification and virus assemblage characterization
5 L of an enrichment culture , or 0.2 m filtered and centrifuged ( 10 min at 3000g ) cell-free supernatant , is spotted onto carbon/formvar-coated electron microscope grids ( Ted Pella or EM Sciences ) .
It is then allowed to absorb for 2 min .
Remove sample from grid by slowly bringing a small ( ca . 1cm2 ) piece of filter paper perpendicular to the grid to the side of the grid .
The sample will be removed by wicking .
Stain grid by placing on a 5 L drop of 2 % Uranyl Acetate ( or Phosphotungstate ) for 15-30 seconds .
Remove stain by wicking as above .
Air dry for at least 10 minutes .
Samples are examined by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , e.g. , JEOL 100 cx , operated at 100 keV .

Estimation of viral-induced phytoplankton mortality using the modified dilution method
To create the grazer-free diluent whole seawater is gravity filtered through acid-washed 0.2 0.45 m filters ( e.g. , PALL Acropak Supor membrane capsules ) into a clean carboy .
After gravity filtration half of the grazer-free diluent is passed through a tangential flow filtration system with kilodalton ( kDa ) pore size to create the virus-free diluent .
The grazer-free and virus-free diluents are added to 10-L polycarbonate bottles in the correct proportions to create the parallel t0 dilution series , e.g. , 20 % , 40 % , 70 % , and 100 % whole water .
The mesoplankton-free whole water is then gently added by siphoning .
From each of these t0 bottles , triplicate 1-L polycarbonate bottles were rinsed twice and then gently filled by siphoning ( to minimize physical damage to the grazers , viruses , and phytoplankton populations ) , ensuring that bottles are filled completely to avoid trapping air bubbles inside upon closure .
After filling , triplicate experimental bottles are placed randomly into experimental conditions .
For determination of phytoplankton composition and abundance and virus abundance , triplicate subsamples ( 5 mL ) are taken from the 10 L t0 dilution bottles and the 0.2 0.45- m and kDa diluents .
Initial ( t0 ) and final ( t24 ) phytoplankton composition and abundance estimates are typically determined by analysis of samples using flow cytometry
Apparent phytoplankton growth rates ( , d 1 ) are calculated from each experimental bottle as the changes in abundance during the incubation using the equation : = ln ( Pt/Po ) /t .
The actual dilution rate is calculated by dividing the t0 phytoplankton abundance in each bottle by the averaged abundance of the replicate t0 100 % counts ( 3 6 bottles ) .

If the DNA will subsequently be used for sequencing , in vitro transcription , or microinjection , add 0.5 ml Buffer QG to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min .
Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube .
To wash , add 0.75 ml Buffer PE to QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min .
Note : If the DNA will be used for salt-sensitive applications ( e.g. , sequencing , blunt-ended ligation ) , let the column stand 2 5 min after addition of Buffer PE .
Centrifuge the QIAquick column once more in the provided 2 ml collection tube for 1 min at 17,900 x g ( 13,000 rpm ) to remove residual wash buffer .
Place QIAquick column into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube .
To elute DNA , add 10 l of Buffer EB ( 10 mM Tris Cl , pH 8.5 ) or water to the center of the membrane , let the column stand for 1 min , and then centrifuge for 1 min .
IMPORTANT : Ensure that the elution buffer is dispensed directly onto the center of the membrane for complete elution of bound DNA .
The average eluate volume is 9 l from 10 l elution buffer volume.Elution efficiency is dependent on pH .
The maximum elution efficiency is achieved between pH 7.0 and 8.5 .
When using water , make sure that the pH value is within this range , and store DNA at 20 C as DNA may degrade in the absence of a buffering agent .
The purified DNA can also be eluted in TE buffer ( 10 mM Tris Cl , 1 mM EDTA , pH 8.0 ) , but the EDTA may inhibit subsequent enzymatic reactions .
If the purified DNA is to be analyzed on a gel , add 1 volume of Loading Dye to 5 volumes of purified DNA .
Mix the solution by pipetting up and down before loading the gel .
Loading dye contains 3 marker dyes ( bromophenol blue , xylene cyanol , and orange G ) that facilitate estimation of DNA migration distance and optimization of agarose gel run time .
Refer to Table 3 ( page 15 ) to identify the dyes according to migration distance and agarose gel percentage and type .

Preparing Biological Samples for Column Chemistry
Filtering Cultures 1.1 Oxalate Wash Preparation Before filtration , make an oxalate wash that will be used in order to remove extracellular iron from diatoms .
Mix consecutively from a to f in 600 ml of ultra pure .
Take up to 1 L ultra pure once Ph 8 is reached .
15.3g , EDTA ; 14.7g , Sodium Citrate ; 0.74g , Potassium Chloride ; 5g , Sodium Chloride ;
Several drops of Sodium Hydroxide until a Ph of 6-712.6g , Oxalic Acid is 1.2 .
Harvest Diatoms Once They Have Been Filtered :
Once cultures have been grown to their optimal density ( approximately 3500 RFU ) , they need to be harvested .
In order to do so , the following items are needed : a pair of tweezers that have been cleaned in 10 % HCl overnight , polycarbonate filters ( 0.1um ) that have been washed in 10 % HCl overnight and rinsed in UPW , 3 bottles : one to collect waste , one that contains ASW and one that contains UPW , oxalate wash , a 60ml syringe , and syringe filter tip .
Label several 15ml tubes with the designated solution numbers on them .
One tube should be labeled for unwashed solutions and a separate tube labeled for washed solutions .
For example , the tubes may say , solution 1 # 1 unwashed , solution 1 # 2 washed .
Once tubes are labeled , assemble the filtration apparatus .
Use polyethylene gloves to handle the tweezers , remove one polycarbonate filter from its container and place on the filter rig .
Screw the reservoir onto the filter rig and rinse the filter with UPW , allowing the water to be filtered through .
Pour 250ml of culture onto the filter and allow it to drain .
Rinse the filter three times with 5ml of ASW .
Once filter has completely drained , unscrew the reservoir with polyethylene gloves , remove the filter with tweezers , and place it in the corresponding 15ml tube that is labeled unwashed .
Syringe filter 60ml of oxalate wash into the remaining 750ml of culture .
Invert bottle once and allow to sit for 30min .
Invert bottle a second time and place a new polycarbonate filter onto the filter rig , rinse with UPW and pour the remaining culture onto filter .
Rinse filter three times with 5ml ASW , drain completely , remove filter , and place in corresponding tube labeled washed .
Repeat these steps until all of the 1L bottles have been filtered .
Rinse tweezers with UPW as well as the filter rig , and put everything back in its place .
Rinse the bottles out with UPW and take them to the clean lab to be cleaned .
All cultures , once filtered , need to be run through columns in order to examine iron limitation .
Preparation for Isotopic Analysis Transfer filter to a clean 15 mL tube for storage .
Transfer the filter into a small teflon ( PFA ) vial .
Add 1 mL conc .
TE clean HCl and 1 mL conc .
TE clean HNO3 to each vial .
CAREFUL : This reaction will produce a corrosive and foul-smelling orange gas .
Place caps loosely on vials and place vials in a fume hood .
IF YOU DECIDE TO PUT THEM ON A HOT PLATE , DO NOT TURN ON HEAT .
( If hotplate is not available , find another good place to store them overnight in a fume hood . )
After the samples have reacted overnight , remove the filters from the vials with a pair of teflon tweezers .
Try to pick up the filter in a way that most of the remaining diatom shells remain on the filter .
The filter will also have a lot of the acid still in it , and this acid contains valuable amounts of Fe .
Rinse off this acid back into the PFA vial by twice pipetting 1 mL of TE H2O over each filter .
Evaporate samples to dryness on a hot plate .
Reconstitute samples in 200 uL of 10N HCl +0.001 % H2O2 .
Collect a subsample before samples are run through columns .
Run samples through mini columns ( 135 uL ) according to established procedures .
While running columns , clean each of your PFA vials by blasting then with TE water from the tap and putting them on the hot plate with 0.1 N HNO3 for an hour or two as columns run .
Elute from the columns into the same PFA vials your samples came out of .
Dry down overnight ( or for a few hours ) .
Re dissolve in 100ul of conc . HNO3 .
Put on hot plate in bio lab , capped , for 30min at 350 .
Take off hot plate in clean lab and put on hot plate in biological lab to dry down .
Reconstitute in 1100ul 0.1N HNO3 Take off 100ul of sample and dilute to 1ml with .1N HNO3 , put in 15 ml vial .
Give the sample from the step above to Tim to run on element .
( This gives the concentration that allows you to calculate step 22 ) .
When you have calculated the amount of Fe in each sample , add enough double-spike to get a 1:2 sample : spike ratio .
The sample is ready for isotopic analysis .

Viruses from Sulfolobus and close relatives
For each sample to be collected , one anaerobic collection vessel ( Fig 1A in guidelines ) is prepared .
A small amount ( ca . 50 220 mg ) of elemental sulfur ( e.g. , Riedel-deHa n ) is placed in an anaerobic tube .
0.1 mL of a 2 % resazurin solution and 0.1 mL of water saturated with H2S are added .
The air in the tube is displaced with CO2 and N2 by the Hungate technique and the tube is stoppered ( Hungate et al . 1966 ) .
A cap is placed on the tube and the assemblage autoclaved .
Liquid and wet sediment samples are collected from turbid terrestrial hot springs with high temperature > 70 C and low pH < 4 .
Samples are collected in sterile 50-mL conical flasks at the end of an extendible pole with a clamp ( see Fig . 1A in guidelines ) .
After most of the sediment is allowed to settle , the pH of the liquid is carefully adjusted to ca . 5.5 with solid CaCO3 by slow addition and stirring .
Once the pH is adjusted the sample is transferred to a pre-prepared anaerobic tube using a syringe ( see above and Fig . 1A in guidelines ) .
If the resazurin indicator changes to pink , drops of H2S-saturated water are added until the sample clears .
Samples can be maintained for up to 2 weeks at room temperature before enrichment .
Samples collected either in anaerobic tubes or filled centrifuge tubes are diluted 1:50 or 1:100 in Sulfolobus growth medium* ( Zillig et al . 1994 ) .
Incubate samples at 80 C with shaking ( 150 rpm ) for up to 2 weeks .
The medium was buffered with 0.7 g glycine per liter and the pH was adjusted to pH 3 3.5 with 1:2 diluted sulfuric acid .
For long-term 80 C growth , our favorite bath liquid is PEG 400 , which is a noncorrosive , nontoxic , water soluble compound that does not evaporate ( see Fig . 1B in guidelines ) .
When growth is detected by either an increase in turbidity or production of a characteristic damp sock odor ( W. Zillig pers . comm . ) , samples are plated on Gelrite plates ( see below and Fig . lC in guidelines ) , rediluted 1:50 , and screened for VLP production by a spot-onlawn assay ( see below and Fig . 1D in guidelines ) or electron microscopy ( see below and Fig . 2 in guidelines ) .
The second round of enrichment culture is also plated and screened for virus production .
Plates are made by slowly adding 6 10 grams/L Gelrite ( Kelco ) to Sulfolobus media ( see above ) and boiling until dissolved .
Calcium ( Ca ( NO3 ) 2 ) and magnesium ( MgCl2 ) are added to a final concentration of 1.5 and 5 mM , respectively , to stabilize the gel .
Before the gel solidifies , ca . 25 mL is poured into standard ( 90 mm ) Petri plates with cams .
After the Gelrite solidifies , plates can be stored at 4 C indefinitely .
Approximately 0.1 mL , from undiluted to 10-3 , of enrichment cultures are spread on Gelrite plates in the presence or absence of 0.5 mL 0.2 % Gelrite dissolved in Sulfolobus medium .
Plates are incubated inverted in airtight moist containers at 75 80 C for approximately 1 week before colonies appear ( Fig . 1C in guidelines ) .

A degenerate primer reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction protocol to determine the diversity of picorna-like viruses
Whole seawater ( if intracellular viruses are to be included in the analysis ) or 0.22-filtered seawater ( if only the free virus community is targeted ) is gently filtered ( 7 mmHg ) through a 0.02 m aluminum oxide filter ( Anotop , Whatman ) .
Filtration should continue until the rate slows dramatically or drops to zero .
Use pumped air to remove as much residual sample as possible .
Once dry , seal the filter inlets and outlets with parafilm .
Label the filter .
Flash-freeze the filter in liquid nitrogen .
Store it at 80 C until extraction .
Total nucleic acids are extracted from the aluminum oxide filters using a Masterpure complete DNA and RNA Purification kit ( Epicenter , Biotechnologies ) .
Remove contaminating DNA from RNA preparations with the Turbo DNA-free kit ( Applied Biosystems ) as described in the protocol provided with the kit .
Each cDNA reaction contains 11 L of extracted Turbo DNA-free treated RNA template , 0.2 mM of each dNTP , and 100 ng of N6 primer in a total volume of 13 L .
Denaturation and annealing of the primers to the RNA template occurs by heating the sample to 65 C for 5 min and then cooling it on ice .
While still on ice , DTT ( 0.5 mM final conc . ) is added to the reaction as an enzyme stabilization reagent with 40 U RNase OUT ( Invitrogen ) to protect the sample from RNAse activity .
The complementary DNA strand is synthesized with 200 U Superscript III ( Invitrogen ) Reverse Transcriptase .
The final reaction volume should be 20 L .
The reaction is incubated initially at 25 C for 5 min so that the relatively unstable hexamer primers remain annealed to the template while cDNA synthesis commences .
The temperature is then increased to 50 C , the temperature at which Superscript III s processivity is highest , for 60 min .
The activity of the enzyme is terminated by incubating the reaction at 85 C for 5 min .
After cDNA synthesis , add 1 L ( 2 U ) of RNase H ( Invitrogen ) to the reaction and incubate at 37 C for 20 min to digest the RNA template from the cDNA : RNA molecule .
PCR can be performed with the RdRp , Mpl.sc1 , Mpl.sc2 , Mplsc3 , and Mpl.cdh primer sets listed in Table 1 and the cDNA synthesized in the previous step .
In a 0.2 mL nuclease-free PCR tube , add reaction components to achieve final concentrations of 1 Platinum Taq buffer , 3 mM MgCl2 , 0.2 mM of each dNTP , 1 M of each primer , and 1 unit of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase ( Invitrogen ) .
Incubate the reactions with the following thermal cycling conditions : 94 C for 75 s ( this is necessary to activate the enzyme and ensures complete initial denaturation of template ) , followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 C for 45 s , annealing at a primer-specific temperature ( Table 1 ) for 45 s , and extension at 72 C for 45 s .
Complete the cycle with a single final extension step of 9 min 15 s at 72 C .
Before gel separation , we purify and concentrate the PCR reactions with a MinElute PCR cleanup column ( Qiagen ) as described by the manufacturer .
Purified PCR products are loaded onto a 1 % agarose gel containing 1 SYBR safe stain ( Invitrogen ) and 0.5 TBE buffer .
Bands of DNA of the appropriate size ( approximately 500 bp ) are excised and purified with a MinElute Gel Extraction kit ( Qiagen ) according to the manufacturer s instructions .
We recommend eluting DNA from the column with three washes of 10 L nuclease-free water in preparation for the end repair reaction .
In preparation for ligation , PCR products are polished and phosphorylated with the PCRTerminator End Repair kit ( Lucigen ) as described by the manufacturer .
After a 15-min incubation at room temperature the reaction is purified and concentrated with a MinElute Reaction Cleanup column ( Qiagen ) .
The eluted PCR products are subsequently ligated into the pSMART-HCKan vector ( Lucigen ) according to the manufacturer .
After terminating the ligation reaction by incubating for 15 min at 70 C , 2 L of the ligation reaction is transformed into Ecloni 10G Supreme cells ( Lucigen ) via electroporation .
Before initiating a large-scale sequencing effort , we recommend screening 10 to 20 colonies for inserts by PCR amplification with the primers SL1 and SR2 ( Table 1 ) to assess the quality of the library .
Colony PCR products can be visualized on a gel and the products in the correct size range purified and sequenced .

Isolation of cyanophages by plaque assays
Prepare base plates Prepare top agar/agarose .
Prepare target indicator cells .
Prepare the sample : Environmental samples should be prefiltered as described earlier .
Adsorb 50 to 100 L sample ( as is , and 10-fold serial dilutions , up to ca . 3 levels ) to 0.5 mL target cells under the usual culturing conditions ( e.g. , for Synechococcus sp . strain DC2 , constant 5 25 mol quanta m 2s 1 , at 25 C ) , agitate occasionally to encourage adsorption of phage to host .
After 1 h , transfer virus : host mixture to 2.5 mL soft agar .
Quickly and gently vortex the mixture and pour the entire tube contents onto the surface of the agar plate .
Working rapidly , gently rock and swirl the plate to spread the mixture evenly onto the plate surface before the agar starts to gel .
Set aside on a flat surface to harden ( about 1 h ) .
Prepare a control plate containing only cells ; this plate will allow you to monitor cell growth .
Seal plate with parafilm , flip plates upside down .
Incubation of plates under constant low light conditions ( 5 to 25 mol quanta m 2s 1 ) will produce darker lawns thus allowing for easier detection of plaques .
Note the number of plaque forming units ( PFUs ) , plaque size , and morphology .
Choose a well-isolated plaque on a plate that contains less than 100 PFUs .
Harvest the plaque using a Pasteur pipette : gently press the tip of the pipette into the plaque to the bottom agar ; using gentle suction , remove the plug .
Transfer the plug to 1 mL media and vortex briefly to break it up .
Place the tube at 4 C and allow the phages particle to elute from the plug overnight to form a plaque lysate .
Vortex and centrifuge the sample ( ca .
12,000g for 10 min ) to pellet cyanobacteria and agar .
Transfer the supernatant to a new tube ; typical titer of the plaque lysate can be 104 to 105 PFU mL 1 .
Repeat steps 14 to 19 for a minimum of 3 plaques .
Choosing plaques with different morphologies may result in the isolation of different phages .

Fingerprinting aquatic virus communities using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ( DGGE )
Using lint-free tissues , wash glass plates , spacers , and combs thoroughly with 70 % ethanol .
Assemble the gel sandwich by placing the small glass plate on top of the large plate , being sure to correctly place a 1-mm spacer along each edge of the plate assembly .
To prevent current leakage and the resultant smiles in the bands near the edges of the gel , grease both sides of the spacers with as little as possible silicon grease to cover the full length of the spacer but only a quarter of the spacer width .
Attach the plate clamps and place the entire assembly into the casting stand .
Inspect the plate assembly to ensure that the two glass plates and the spacers form a flush surface along the sides , and ensure that all gaskets adequately seal the plate assembly .
Check the gradient maker and flush with sdH2O .
Empty pump tubing and attach pipette tip at the outlet tube to the top-middle of the gel chamber .
To optimize the gradient conditions for a new DGGE experiment ( new primer sets , new sample type/habitat , etc . ) , we usually start with a relatively broad gradient ( 20 % to 80 % denaturant ) .
We then focus the gradient around the area of interest to include the highest and lowest bands in different samples .
Table 1 ( guidelines ) can be used to determine the appropriate composition of the denaturing gradient gel ( 16 16 cm ) that has a total volume of 29 mL .
Make up two solutions of 14.5 mL each , a low denaturant concentration solution and a high denaturant concentration solution .
Mix the solutions A and B ( guidelines ) to the desired percentage .
After preparing the denaturing gel solutions , degas for 15 min and filter through a 0.45-mm syringe filter .
Immediately before casting the gel , add 145 L 10 % APS and 7.25 L TEMED into each solution and swirl gently to mix .
At this point , you will have approximately 10 min to pour the gel .
Make sure the pump is off and the gradient maker-channel is closed ( handle up ) .
Pour solution with the highest denaturant in the right leg of the gradient maker ( at the pump side ) and the solution with the lowest denaturant in the left leg .
Turn the magnetic stirrer on , while simultaneously starting the pump ( 5 mL/min ) .
Simultaneously , start the pump ( 5 mL/min ) and move the handle of the gradient maker to horizontal position ( channel open ) .
Use approximately 4 5 min to fill the gel .
Empty the tubing and flush thoroughly with sdH2O .
Insert the comb , flat or straight side down , making sure that there are no bubbles under the comb .
Different combs ( 16 or 20 wells ) are available , depending on the number of samples that you want to run .
Cover gels with cling film and allow ~2 h for the gel to polymerize .
The gel can be kept at 4 C until the next day .
Prepare approximately 7 L of 1 TAE and fill the buffer chamber .
Put about 0.5 L aside for later use .
To enhance the circulation of the running buffer , place the tank on a magnet stirrer and add a magnetic stirrer bar in the bottom of the tank .
Preheat the buffer in the DCode apparatus to 60 C ; this will take about 2 h. Attach the gel plates to the core assembly .
Loosen the clamps a quarter-turn counterclockwise to prevent breaking of the sandwich clamps ( due to heat expansion ) .
Then place the core assembly into the heated buffer in the tank .
Switch off the magnetic stirrer ( if loading in tank ) .
Flush each well with buffer using syringe with needle to remove any unpolymerized acrylamide and excess urea .
Flush each well with buffer again before loading approximately 10 50 L of PCR products mixed with loading dye into each well .
To quantify PCR products , we recommend gel quantification using a DNA mass standard ( e.g. , Low DNA Mass ladder ; Invitrogen ) and commercially available gel quantification software such as Quantity One ( Bio-Rad ) or free software such as Image J ( available for download at http : //rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/download.html ) .
In the DGGE gel , load a marker on each side of the gel adjacent to the samples ( markers can be custom made for each DGGE application using known PCR products , or common molecular weight markers can be used ) for determination of band positions , or comparisons of different gels .
Apply a loading voltage of 200 V for 5 min before starting the pump to circulate the buffer , then turn on the magnetic stirrer .
The length of the run and the running voltage depend on the size of the PCR products and the percentage of acrylamide/bis in the gel .
A good starting point is to run the gel at 60 V ( about 20 mA for one gel ) for 19 h .
When the electrophoresis is complete , take apart the apparatus and remove the glass plates from the gel clamps .
Carefully separate the plates , leaving the gel exposed on the large plate .
Use the edge of the small plate to trim the well walls , but be sure to leave the leftmost wall slightly higher than the others for use as a gel orientation reference .
For easy manipulation , the gel can either be stained on the large plate or transferred to , stained on , and transported on a plastic sheet .
Stain the gel for 30 min in 50 500 mL fluorescent gel stain .
Destain the gel for 30 min in 1 TAE .
Remember , the fluorescent dye binds to nucleic acids ; therefore , it is important to minimize contact with skin , so gloves ( powder-free ) should be worn .
If staining in a container , use plastic and not glass , as the fluorescent dyes accumulate over time on glass surfaces .
Slide the gel off of the plastic sheet or large plate onto a UV transilluminator and view the gel .
Bacteriophage isolation by spotting on target host cells
The host cells are grown overnight in liquid cultures containing an appropriate growth medium for the organism .
Measure optical density spectrophotometrically at 525 nm ( OD525 ) and adjust OD to 0.3 0.5 with growth medium .
Soft agar ( 0.5 to 0.6 % agar in media of choice ) is melted in a water bath or a microwave oven .
Aliquot 4mL of soft agar into sterile tubes and keep just above solidification temperature until use .
200 300 L bacterial culture is added to the 4 mL tubes with melted soft agar .
The bacteria-soft agar mixture is then vortexed and immediately poured onto an agar plate with an agar that supports growth of the host bacterium .
Distribute bacteria-soft agar mixture evenly on the plate , which is placed on a flat surface .
When the soft agar containing the target bacteria has solidified , triplicate aliquots of 5 10 L of each of the environmental water samples from which phages should be isolated are spotted on top of the soft agar .
As a negative control 5 10 L phage buffer ( e.g. , SM buffer : 450 mM NaCl , 50 mM MgSO4 , 50 mM Tris , 0.01 % Gelatin , pH = 8 ) or 0.02 m filtered sample water is spotted in triplicate on the soft agar .
The plates are incubated for 1 3 d depending on the growth rate of the bacteria , and the presence of lytic phages in the sample is detected as a clearing zone ( plaque ) in the spotted area of the lawn of bacteria that develops over time on the plate .
If clearing zones appear in the spotted area , this indicates the presence of lytic phages , which can be isolated and purified .
Once detected as clearings in the spotting zone , phages are further isolated and purified from the plates .

Isolation of Haloviruses from Natural Waters
Salt lake samples are collected from hypersaline waters , which typically range from 15 % w/v total salt , up to saturation ( ca 35 % ) .
Samples are collected in sterile 5 10 mL vessels and may be stored for several weeks at room temperature .
In the laboratory , cells and cellular debris are removed by centrifugation ( 5,000g , 10 min , room temperature ) .
The supernatant is then screened directly for viruses by plaque assay .
The choice of host strains depends on the experimental objectives , and includes well-characterized members of the Halobacteriaceae , such as Hbt .
salinarum ( host for H and several others ) or Har .
hispanica ( host for SH1 , His1 , His2 , and others ) , or natural isolates from the same source , such as Hrr .
coriense ( host for HF2 ) .
Base and overlay plates ( 90 mm ) are made with MGM ( see guidelines ) , solidified using 15 % w/v agar .
A range of salt water concentrations should be examined , because salt concentration seems to greatly affect the size and clarity of plaques .
Plates can be stored indefinitely at 4 C ( wrapped in plastic to prevent dessication ) , but should be warmed to room temperature or warmer for use .
For virus isolation , 100 500 l of the cleared water sample is mixed with 150 l of exponentially growing host cells .
Then , 3 4 mL of molten ( 50 C ) top-layer MGM ( with 0.7 % w/v agar ) is added , and the solution mixed gently and poured evenly over the plate .
After setting on a level surface for 5 10 min , plates are incubated aerobically , inverted in airtight containers at 30 C and 37 C for 1 4 d , and checked every day for plaques .
Any visible plaques are picked using sterile glass Pasteur pipettes , or sterile plastic micropipette tips .
These agar plugs are then transferred to tubes containing 500 l of halovirus diluent : 2.47 M , NaCl ; 90 mM , MgCl2 ; 90 mM , MgSO4 ; 60 mM , KCl ; 3 mM , CaCl2 ; 10 mM , Tris-HCl , pH 7.5 ;
They are then vortexed to homogenize the sample .
These suspensions are then replaqued on overlay plates to purify the isolates and to eliminate false plaques caused by artifacts in the agar overlay or contaminants in the water sample .

Just prior to sample DNA extraction , add enough standard DNA to each sample to reach ~0.1-1.0 % of expected total reads .
Following sequencing , quantify the number of genomic standard reads ( steps 8 and 9 ) .
Using a bit score cutoff of 50 , identify standard reads by BLASTn homology search aganst the internal standard genome .
Using the results from step 8 and a bit score cutoff of 40 , perform a BLASTx against the RefSeq Protein database to identify all protein encoding reads derived from the internal standard genome .
Quantify recovered standard DNA reads and remove from dataset .
Calculate the number of molecules of internal standard recovered from sequencing : Sr=SS/SPSr = number of molecules of internal standard genome recovered from sequencingSS = number of protein encoding internal standard reads in the sequence librarySP = number of protein encoding genes in the internal standard reference genome .
Calculate the community gene pool size : Pg=Ps* ( Sa/Sr ) Pg = total number of protein encoding genes in the samplePs = number of protein encoding sequences in the metagenome librarySa = number of molecules of internal standard genome added to the sampleSr = number of molecules of internal standard genome recovered from sequencing .
Calculate individual gene abundances for genes of interest : Ga=Gs* ( Pg/Ps ) Ga = number of molecules of any particular gene category in the sample .

Pre-hybridization for Probes .
[ 3.1 ] Remove as much of the Permeabilization Buffer as possible from the sample .
Incubate sample in 500 L of 50 % Hyb Buffer at 65 C for 30 min .
[ 3.2 ] Change sample into 500 L of fresh 50 % Hyb Buffer , and incubate at 65 C for 2.5 h .
Note : Prevent drying during prolonged incubations .
When using petri plates , place them in a humidified chamber or seal the cover of the plate with a strip of parafilm .
Probe Hybridization .
To identify possible artifacts and confounding effects , the following alternate sample preparations should be performed :
Autofluorescence ( AF ) Follow protocol but do not add probes ( step 4 ) or hairpins ( step 7 ) .
Non-Specific Amplification of hairpins ( NSA ) Sample incubated without probes ( step 4 ) but with hairpins included .
Non-Specific Detection of targets ( NSD ) This control is applicable only for ( i ) transgenic ( non-endogenous ) targets , where a wild-type sample missing the target transcript is treated using the same protocol , and with the test probes and hairpins ; or ( ii ) non-ubiquitous endogenous target transcript , where the locus of expression is known beforehand , and for which surrounding tissue can give an estimate of NSD in the same sample after treatment .
[ 4.1 ] Mix 1 pmol of each probe in 500 L of 50 % Hyb buffer at 45 C for 30 min ( this step should be coordinated with step [ 3.2 ] so that they are completed at the same time ) .
[ 4.2 ] Remove the 50 % Hyb buffer from [ 3.2 ] , and add this probe solution to samples for overnight ( 16 h ) incubation at 45 C .
Probe Washes .
All solutions used here must be pre-warmed to 45 C .
Probe solution is not reused , and hence discarded at the start of the washes .
[ 5.1 ] Wash samples in 500 L Probe Wash Buffer for 15 min at 45 C .
[ 5.2 ] Wash samples in 500 L ( 75 % of Probe Wash Buffer + 25 % of 5X SSC ) for 15 min at 45 C .

[ 5.4 ] Wash samples in 500 L ( 25 % of Probe Wash Buffer + 75 % of 5X SSC ) for 15 min at 45 C .
[ 5.5 ] Wash samples 2 times , in 500 L of 5X SSC for 15 min at 45 C .
[ 5.6 ] Wash samples 2 times , in 500 L of 5X SSC for 30 min at 45 C .
Pre-hybridization for Hairpins [ 6.1 ] Incubate samples in 500 L of DNA Amplification Buffer at RT for 30 min .
[ 6.2 ] Incubate samples in fresh 500 L of DNA Amplification Buffer at RT for 30 min .
[ 6.3 ] Aliquot 6 pmol ( for every 100 L of DNA Amplification Buffer ) of each hairpin in a separate PCR tube .
[ 6.4 ] Heat the hairpins to 95 C for 90 sec ( e.g. , using a PCR machine/thermal cycler ) .
[ 6.5 ] Store the heated hairpins in the dark for 30 min at RT ( keep hairpins unmixed ) .
[ 6.6 ] Prepare 100 L of fresh DNA Amplification Buffer equilibrated at RT .
Note : ( Steps [ 6.2 ] through [ 6.6 ] should be coordinated so that they are completed at the same time for all samples ) .
Hairpin Amplification .
[ 7.1 ] Mix all hairpins in 100 L of pre-equilibrated DNA Amplification Buffer at RT .
( Final concentration of each hairpin is 60 nM . )
Note : The volume of this incubation can be scaled up if needed ( i.e. , for high-abundance squid transcripts ) ; however , the hairpin concentration must be kept constant .
[ 7.2 ] Remove final wash solution from [ 6.2 ] and add the hairpin solution to the samples for an overnight ( 16 h ) incubation at RT .
[ 7.3 ] Wrap the sample tubes ( or incubation oven ) in aluminum foil to keep light out .
Hairpin Washes .
Note : All solutions used here must be pre-equilibrated to RT .
[ 8.1 ] Wash samples 4 times , in 500 L of 5X SSCTw for 5 min each at RT .
[ 8.2 ] Wash samples 2 times , in 500 L of 5X SSCTw for 30 min each at RT .
Imaging .
[ 9.1 ] Samples can be imaged directly in 5X SSCTw , or stored in 5X SSCTw at 4 C .
Note : The processed samples can be counterstained with phalloidin or wheat germ agglutinin following standard protocols .
Purification of pooled PCR amplicon libraries using SPRI beads
Vortex AMPure XP or RXN pureplus SPRI beads to resuspend .
Make your pooled library up to 100 l if necessary .
Add 60 l resuspended SPRI beads to 100 l of pooled PCR product .
Mix well by pipetting up and down at least 10 times .
Vortex AMPure XP beads to resuspend .
Incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature .
Quickly spin the tube and place it on an appropriate magnetic stand to separate beads from supernatant .
After the solution is clear ( about 5 minutes ) , carefully remove and discard the supernatant .
Be careful not to disturb the beads that contain DNA targets ( Caution : do not discard beads ) .
Add 200 l of 80 % freshly prepared ethanol to the tube while in the magnetic stand .
Incubate at room temperature for 30 seconds , and then carefully remove and discard the supernatant .
