OmniPrep For High Quality Genomic DNA Extraction From Yeast
Aliquot 1.5ml yeast overnight culture into a 1.5ml microfuge tube and centrifuge at 14,000xg for 30 seconds.
Discard the supernatant.
Add 150 l PBS, 5 l LongLife Zymolyase and 1 l -mercaptoethanol to the pellet and gently vortex to resuspend.
Incubate at 37 C for 30 minutes with periodic mixing.
Incubate the sample at 55-60 C for 15 minutes.
Do not heat higher than 60 C.
OPTIONAL : For maximum DNA recovery, add 1 l Proteinase K solution for every 100 l Lysis Buffer and incubate at 60 C for 1-2 hours.
Invert the tube periodically each hour.
This step will digest hard to handle tissues and significantly improve the yield.
Allow the sample to cool to room temperature.
Add 200 l chloroform and mix by inverting the tube several times.
Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 14,000xg and carefully remove the upper phase to a clean microcentrifuge tube.
Add 50 l DNA Stripping Solution to the sample and invert several times to mix.
Incubate the sample for 5-10 minutes at 60 C.
Add 100 l Precipitation Solution and mix by inverting the tube several times.
Centrifuge the sample at 14,000xg for 5 minutes.
Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube and precipitate the genomic DNA with 500 l isopropanol.
Invert the tubes 10 times to precipitate the DNA.
OPTIONAL : For increased DNA recovery, add 2 l Mussel Glycogen as a DNA carrier.
Centrifuge at 14,000xg for 5 minutes to pellet genomic DNA.
Remove the supernatant.
Add 700 l 70 % ethanol to the tube and invert several times to wash the DNA pellet.
Centrifuge for 1 minute at 14,000xg.
Decant or pipette off the ethanol wash.
Invert the tube on a clean absorbent surface for several minutes to allow any excess ethanol to drain away.
Add 50 l TE Buffer to the pellet.
Incubate at room temperature for at least 15 minutes to rehydrate.
OPTIONAL : 1 l LongLife RNase for every 100 l TE Buffer can be added at this stage.
Store DNA at 4 C, for long term storage store at -20 C or -80 C.
Centrifuge for 5 minutes at 14,000xg and pour off the supernatant.
Gently vortex the tube to resuspend the pellet in the residual liquid.
Add 500 l Genomic Lysis Buffer and mix by inverting the tube several times.
Do not vortex.
