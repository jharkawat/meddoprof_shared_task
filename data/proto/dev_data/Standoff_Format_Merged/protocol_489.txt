Bead Beating RNA extraction from 25 mm filter
Turn on 4 C centrifuge.
Thaw internal standards on ice.
Set up 2.0 ml tube adaptor on Mo Bio Vortex Genie 2.
For each sample, prepare a 2.0 ml tube with the following 3-bead mixture : 200 l 0.1 mm zirconium beads, 100 l 0.4-0.6 mm glass beads, 100 l 0.5 mm zirconium beads.
Add Ambion Denaturation Solution to each tube.
To each bead tube, add internal standards to reach ~0.5 % of expected RNA yield.
Place one 25 mm sample filter into each bead tube using RNase-free forceps.
Place sample tubes on vortex adaptor and beat for 5 min.
Switch tube positions and beat another 5 min.
Centrifuge sample tubes for 1 min at 5000 rpm at 4 C.
Transfer as much of the RNA lysate as possible to a new 1.5 ml centrifuge tube (Can carryover some beads).
Centrifuge RNA tubes for 5 min at 5000 rpm at 4 C.
Transfer lysate to new 2.0 ml tube (Do not carry over any beads).
Add 1 volume of 100 % ethanol to the lysate.
Draw the RNA lysate up into a 3.0 ml syringe with a 21g1 gauge needle and pass it back out 8 times to shear RNA.
Apply 700 L of RNA lysate to RNeasy mini column.
Close tube gently and centrifuge 15 sec at 13000 rpm.
Discard flow-through.
Repeat steps 16-18 until entire sample has been applied to column.
Add 700 l Buffer RW1 to RNeasy Mini spin column.
Centrifuge for 15 sec at 13000 rpm.
Discard the flow-through.
Add 500 l Buffer RPE to RNeasy spin column.
Centrifuge for 15 sec at 13000 rpm.
Discard flow-through.
Add 500 l Buffer RPE to RNeasy spin column.
Centrifuge for 2 min at 13000 rpm.
Place column in new 2.0 ml collection tube.
Centrifuge for 1 min at 13000 rpm.
Place column in a new 1.5 ml sterile tube.
Add 35 l RNase-free water directly onto filter and close the lid.
Incubate tube for 1 min at room temperature.
Centrifuge for 1 min at 13000 rpm.
Add another 35 l RNase-free water into same column/tube.
Incubate for 1 min at room temperature.
Centrifuge for 1 min at 13000 rpm.
Discard column and place tube with RNA on ice.
Quantify extracted RNA with Nanodrop (2 l).
Mix the following in a 1.5 ml tube :
componentamountextracted sample50 lRNase-free water40 lDNase reaction buffer10 lTurbo DNase3 l.
Incubate for 20 min at 37 C.
Add 3 l more Turbo DNase to sample.
Incubate an additional 20 min at 37 C.
Add 20 l inactivation solution to sample (make sure solution is well mixed).
Vortex on and off for ~4 min.
Spin for 1 min at 13000 rpm.
Carefully, without disturbing inactivation reagent, remove supernatant (~100 l) into a new 1.5 ml tube and place on ice.
Quantify DNased RNA with Nanodrop (2 l)
Optional : Clean and concentrate DNased RNA using Zymo RNA Clean & Concentrator-5 according to manufacturer protocol.
Store RNA at -80 C
