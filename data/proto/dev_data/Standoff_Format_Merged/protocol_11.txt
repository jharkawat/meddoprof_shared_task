Dephosphorylation using CIP in Restriction Enzyme Reaction (M0290)
Digest 1 5 g of plasmid DNA in a 20 l reaction as follows : DNA 1 l ; Restriction Enzyme Buffer (10X) 2 l ; Restriction Endonuclease 1 l ; H2O, purified to 20 l.
Incubate at 37 C for 60 minutes or follow manufacturer s recommendations.
Add 1 unit of CIP for every 1 pmol of DNA ends (about 1 g of a 3 kb plasmid).
Incubate at 37 C for 30 60 minutes.
Purify DNA by gel purification, spin-column or phenol extraction.
Proceed with ligation.
