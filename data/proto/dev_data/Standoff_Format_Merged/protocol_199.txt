Protocol for STO Cell Transfection by FuGENE HD
STO cells were seeded the day before transfection with the density 15,000 cells per well in 100 l complete growth medium DMEM+10 % Fetal Bovine Serum.
Prepare 0.02 g/ l pCMV plasmid DNA solution in OptiMEM.
Add 6 l of reagent to 100 l of OptiMEM /DNA solution.
Mix carefully by pipetting (10-15 times).
Incubate 5 min at room temperature.
Add 5 l complex per well to the cells, and mix thoroughly.
Place the cells into CO2 incubator for 26-28 hours.
Remove the medium from the well and wash the cells once with 100 l per well PBS.
Fix the cells in the well with 50 l solution of 4 % formaldehyde in PBS for 5min at room temperature.
Wash each well with 100 l PBS.
(1/2) Add 50 l per well of substrate/stain solution and incubate the plate overnight at 37 C.
Observe the cells under microscope and evaluate the proportion of blue (-gal-positive) cells.
Wash each well with 100 l PBS.
